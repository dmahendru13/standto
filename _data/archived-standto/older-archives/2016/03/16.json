    "body": "##### Provided by USASMDC/ARSTRAT \n\n### What is it?\n\nThe Army Space Training Strategy provides an integrated framework to educate and train Soldiers at every grade level and echelon about current space capabilities available to them and mitigation procedures when those capabilities become contested. This strategy was signed in November 2013 and is directed by the 2011 Army Strategic Space Plan.   \n \n\n### What has the Army done? \n\nThe U.S. Army assigned the [U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command](http://www.army.mil/info/organization/unitsandcommands/commandstructure/smdc/) (USASMDC/ARSTRAT), in collaboration with the [U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/) (TRADOC), the task of integrating space training and education in courses at Centers of Excellence and Professional Military Education (PME). \n\nUSASMDC/ARSTRAT works closely with [U.S. Army Forces\nCommand](http://www.forscom.army.mil/) to integrate contested space\noperations into training venues such as the Combat Training Centers (CTC). The intent is to provide subject matter expertise in contested space operations and support to the CTC observer/controller teams and the opposing force.\n\n \n\n### What does the Army have planned for the future? \n\nUSASMDC/ARSTRAT will continue integration efforts across three lines of effort:\n\n* **Institutional**:  Review/revise doctrine and tactics, techniques and procedures; ensure appropriate levels of space content in courses throughout the Army's PME programs and Centers of Excellence. \n* **Operational**:  Integrate space training at home station and CTC; build requirements for training devices that create realistic contested space operational environments.\n* **Space Cadre Development**:  Assess and improve space cadre training and distribution of space billets throughout the Army.\n\n \n### Why is this important to the Army? \n\nThe Army relies on space capabilities to enable all warfighting functions, and Soldiers require training to operate their space-enabled systems when access to space is denied, degraded, or disrupted.  Access to position, navigation, and timing data and communications via satellites are particularly important to the effective execution of mission command.   \n\n### Resources:\n\n* [U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command](http://www.army.mil/info/organization/unitsandcommands/commandstructure/smdc/)\n* CAC log-in required: [Army Space Knowledge Management System](https://army.deps.mil/army/sites/ASKMS/SitePages/Home.aspx) (ASKMS)\n\n \n#### Related video:\n* [USASMDC/ARSTRAT Command Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTkfD9uh3BQ&feature=youtu.be)\n\n#### Related documents:\n* [U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command](http://www.smdc.army.mil/FactSheets/SMDC.pdf)\n* [Tri-fold ](http://www.smdc.army.mil/FactSheets/SMDC_trifold.pdf)\n* [Supporting the Warfighter](http://www.smdc.army.mil/FactSheets/Jointtrifold.pdf)\n\n\n#### Related STAND-TO!: \n* [Army Space Personnel Development Office](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2016-02-04)\n* [The Army Space Cadre](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/2010/09/28)\n \n\n\n",
