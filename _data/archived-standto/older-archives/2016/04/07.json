    "body": "##### Provided by Combined Arms Center\n\n### What is it?\n\nWarrant Officers are the U.S. Army's premier technical experts and systems integrators whose leader development is critically important for readiness. The Army Warrant Officer 2025 Strategy (WO2025) provides vision and guidance on the ends, ways and means for accessing, developing and using WOs to best serve the Army now and in the future. \n\n### What has the Army done? \n\nThe [WO2025 Strategy](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/tpubs/misc/WO2025_Strategy_20160329.pdf) was developed and synchronized with the [Army Operating Concept](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-12-22/), [Force 2025 and Beyond](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-03-27/), [Human Dimension Strategy](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-07-03/), [Army Leader Development Strategy](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-06-19/) and Warrant Officer Continuum of Learning Study. These documents serve as the foundation and guiding principles for the shaping of the warrant officer of the future.The WO2025 Strategy also applies the [Army Warfighting Challenges](http://www.arcic.army.mil/Initiatives/army-warfighting-challenges.aspx) to frame the learning and collaboration required for the future force. \n\n### What continued efforts have been planned for the future?\n\nThe WO2025 Strategy is organized into four distinct Lines of Effort (LOEs) that are synchronized with the AWCs. The LOEs emphasize redesigning the recruiting and selection process, revitalizing WO professional military education, posturing leader development for effective utilization and joint force integration, and institutionalizing a culture of professionalism. The LOEs are:\n\n(1) Accessions: In order to meet the demanding and unknown future requirements identified in the Army Operating Concept, the Army will reevaluate the current accessions model. \n\n(2) Development: WOs serve as the Army's technical experts, systems operators, integrators and collective trainers of Soldiers. Development efforts will focus on sustaining and improving these competencies to enhance readiness and reduce reliance on contractor support. \n\n(3) Talent Management and Utilization: The Army will review how WOs are managed and assigned and develop ways to ensure top talent is retained and placed in the best possible roles. \n\n(4) Army Profession: The Army will develop WO cohort specific materials to increase understanding, improve mentorship and counseling, as well as enhance the pride and esprit de corps of all service members. \n\n\n### Why is this important to the Army? \n\nThe WO2025 Strategy provides strategic direction to ensure Army Warrant Officers are technologically agile, adaptive, and innovative leaders. \n\n### Resources:\n\n* [U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command](http://www.tradoc.army.mil)\n* [U.S. Army Combined Arms Center](http://usacac.army.mil/)\n* [The Army University](http://armyu.army.mil)\n\n\n#### Related documents:\n* [The Army Warrant Officer 2025 Strategy](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/tpubs/misc/WO2025_Strategy_20160329.pdf)\n* [ADRP 1: Army Profession](http://armypubs.army.mil/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_a/pdf/adrp1.pdf)\n* [TRADOC PAM 525-8-2: The U.S. Army Learning Concept](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/tpubs/pams/tp525-8-2.pdf)\n* [TRADOC PAM 525-3-1: The Army Operating Concept](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/tpubs/pams/TP525-3-1.pdf)\n* [Army Leader Development Strategy](http://go.usa.gov/ctcbB)\n* [Army Directive 2015-30: Professional Military Education, Leader Development and Talent Management for Warrant Officers](http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/ad2015_30.pdf)\n\n#### Related articles:\n* [Warrants pen draft strategy for retaining technology overmatch](http://www.army.mil/article/151463)\n* [Warrant officers critical to transformation from wartime to sustainment Army](http://www.army.mil/article/151493)\n* [Solarium: Warrants need training, Army over-relies on contractors](http://www.army.mil/article/161079)\n* [Solarium: Some warrants get more broadening than others](http://www.army.mil/article/161225)\n\n#### Related STAND-TO!\n* [Warrant Officer Solarium 2016](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2016-01-13)\n* [The Army Learning Concept-2015](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/2010/10/19)\n* [Army Leader Development Strategy 2013](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-06-19)\n\n\n",
