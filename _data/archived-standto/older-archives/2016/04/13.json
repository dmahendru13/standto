    "body": "##### Provided by TRADOC\n\n### What is it?\n \nThe Junior Leader Army Profession Symposium's purpose is to generate dialogue with approximately 100 junior Army leaders and discuss ways to help refine the emerging concept for Character Development in the Army and deliver an outbrief with recommendations to select senior Army leaders. This effort falls under the fiscal year 2015-2016 America's Army  Our Profession theme, *Living the Army Ethic, Why and How We Serve*, and  is supported by the [Center for the Army Profession and Ethic](http://cape.army.mil) (CAPE) at [Training and Doctrine Command](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/) (TRADOC).\n\n\n\n### What is the Army doing? \n\nIn 2010, the Secretary of the Army and the CSA directed the commanding general of TRADOC to conduct a critical review to assess how the years of war affected members of the Army Profession. The findings led to several initiatives which include: \n\n* Publication of [Army Doctrine Reference Publication 1 (ADRP 1): *The Army Profession*](http://armypubs.army.mil/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_a/pdf/adrp1.pdf)\n* Two CSA's Army Profession symposia at West Point\n*  Senior Army Civilian Army Profession Symposium at the National Defense University, Fort McNair, in 2014\n* Junior Leader Army Profession Symposium at JBLM in 2015 \n\nThe commanding general of [I Corps](http://www.army.mil/icorps) will host the Junior Leader Army Profession Symposium for junior Army leaders (E5-E6; WO1-CW3, O1-O3, and GS 7-9) at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, April 13-14, 2016.\n\n \n### What continued efforts have been planned for the future?\n\nThe Army will continue to increase understanding of all aspects of the Army Profession, including an awareness and inculcation of the [Army Ethic](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-06-15) and the successful accomplishment of [Character Development](http://cape.army.mil/case-studies/vcs-single.php?id=8&title=character-development) for all cohorts through ongoing training and education initiatives with supporting products, and sustained discussion of the topic at all levels.  \n\n\n### Why is this important to the Army? \n\nThe intent for this symposium is to leverage ideas and feedback from junior Army leaders, both military and civilian, to further inform the refinement of the concept for Character Development in the Army. The Army is in a period of strategic transition that presents tremendous opportunities for the profession and must continue to deepen its understanding of what it means to be a profession and have a viable concept for accomplishing Character Development relevant for Soldiers and Army Civilians.\n\n\n### Resources:\n\n* [Mission Command Center of Excellence (MC CoE) ](http://usacac.army.mil/organizations/mccoe)\n* [U.S. Army Combined Arms Center](http://usacac.army.mil)\n* [The Center for the Army Profession and Ethic (CAPE)](http://cape.army.mil/)\n* [U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) ](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/)\n* [Character Development](http://cape.army.mil/case-studies/vcs-single.php?id=8&title=character-development) \n\n#### Related videos: \n\n* [Reflections on Identity: Part 1](http://cape.army.mil/repository/videos/casestudy/reflections-on-identity-part-1.wmv) \n* [Reflections on Identity: Part 2](http://cape.army.mil/repository/videos/casestudy/reflections-on-identity-part-2.wmv)\n\n\n#### Related documents: \n* [Army Ethic White Paper](http://cape.army.mil/repository/white-papers/Army-Ethic-White-Paper.pdf )\n* [ADRP1: The Army Profession](http://armypubs.army.mil/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_a/pdf/adrp1.pdf)\n\n\n\n#### Related STAND-TO!\n* [Army Ethic](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-06-15)\n* [CSA's Strategic Priorities: Waypoint #2](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-02-24 )\n* [Army Leader Development Program](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-04-15)\n* [The Army Profession](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/issue.php?issue=2012-04-16)\n\n",
