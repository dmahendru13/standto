The Army Posture Statement informs Congress on the state of the Army and outlines the Army's accomplishments, initiatives, and priorities for Congress to consider when reviewing the President's budget for the upcoming fiscal year. \n \n### What has the Army done? \n\nThe 2016 Army Posture Statement describes the [Army's vision](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-07-07) for providing ready forces. To remain prepared for contingencies, the Army must make the most of the resources entrusted by the American people.  This ultimately requires a balance of competing requirements -- readiness, end strength, and modernization -- to ensure America's Army remains ready to fight and win both today and in the future. \n\n\n### What continued efforts have been planned for the future?\n\nArmy readiness has been affected by the last three years of reduced funding. To address this, the Army's number one priority is readiness, which has four components - manning, training, equipping, and leader development. These components help to establish how the Army prioritizes its efforts to provide trained and ready forces prepared to fight and win the nation's wars. \n\nThe Army Posture Statement also identifies the five key modernization capability areas: \n\n* Aviation\n* The Network\n* Integrated Air Missile Defense\n* Combat Vehicles\n* Emerging Threats\n\n \n### Why is this important to the Army? \n \nThe Army Posture Statement provides Congress, as well as internal and external audiences, an overview of the Army's plan to build readiness. The Army Posture Statement is an authoritative document that highlights the Army's enduring and vital contribution to the defense of the nation as a member of the Joint Force, its global commitments and vision for the future. \n\n### Resources:\n\n* [2016 Army Posture Statement](http://www.army.mil/e2/rv5_downloads/aps/aps_2016.pdf) can be found at- \n* [U.S. Army website: Army Posture Statement](http://www.army.mil/aps/?from=st)\n* [Secretary of the Army](http://www.army.mil/leaders/sa/?from=st)\n* [Chief of Staff of the Army](http://www.army.mil/leaders/csa/?from=st)\n* [Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing: FY17 U.S. Army Budget](http://www.armed-services.senate.gov/hearings/16-04-07-posture-of-the-department-of-the-army)\n\n#### Related documents: \n\n* [The Army Vision 2015-2025: Strategic Advantage in a Complex World](http://www.army.mil/e2/rv5_downloads/info/references/the_army_vision.pdf)\n* [Defense Strategic Guidance](http://www.defense.gov/news/Defense_Strategic_Guidance.pdf)\n",
