The U.S. Army appreciates the commitment, contributions and sacrifices of the military children and recognizes their role in strong Army Families. The strength of the nation is built on the readiness and resilience of every member of the premier all-volunteer Army including the military children and youth.   \n\nIn 1986, the Department of Defense designated April as Month of the Military Child. This year marks the observance's 30th anniversary. \n\n\n### What has the Army done? \n\nThe Army is fully committed to helping Families remain strong by offering a variety of programs and services through [U.S. Army Installation Management Command](http://www.imcom.army.mil). This year's theme, *Their Journeys and Adventures*, captures the Army's story through the eyes of military children. Throughout the month of April, Army organizations will provide a variety of fun and exciting events such as family fun nights, parades, festivals, and special luncheons, to officially recognize the Army children. \n\nSpecial events for MOMC 2016 include the [Young Lives, Big Stories contest](http://www.armymwr.com/momc-big-stories.aspx), where military children are invited to share their experiences and win prizes, and [Operation Megaphone](http://www.armymwr.com/op-megaphone.aspx), a worldwide lock-in for military teens on April 29-30, 2016. \n\nMOMC activities differ across the Army, but all share the same goal: to celebrate and recognize Army children. \n  \n\n### What continued efforts have been planned for the future?\n\nAs the nation and Army prepare for the future, the Army will continue to anticipate the evolving needs of Soldiers and Families. The Army will continue to refine [Child, Youth and School Services](http://www.armymwr.com/family/childandyouth/) to meet changing needs to ensure healthy, ready, and self-reliant Soldiers and Families.\n\n### Why is this important to the Army? \n\nThe Army remains committed to honoring the service and sacrifices of those who serve the Nation, including Army Families. MOMC is an opportunity to recognize, applaud, and celebrate the resilience of Army children and youth and their role in ensuring a ready force now and into the future. \n\n\n \n\n### Resources:\n\n* [Tri-signed letter: Month of the Military Child Proclamation](http://www.army.mil/e2/rv5_downloads/features/families/momc_trisign_2016.pdf)\n* [Army.mil: Army Families](http://www.army.mil/families)\n* [U.S. Army Family & Morale, Welfare and Recreation](http://www.armymwr.com/momc)\n* [U.S. Army Installation Management Command](http://www.imcom.army.mil)\n* [Military Kids Connect](http://militarykidsconnect.dcoe.mil)\n* [Military OneSource](http://www.militaryonesource.mil)  or call 1-800-342-9647\n\n#### Related Social Media: \n* [IMCOM on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/InstallationManagementCommunity)\n* [IMCOM on Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/armyimcom )\n* [Army MWR on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/FamilyMWR)\n* [Army MWR on Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/FamilyMWR)\n* [Army Teen Panel on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ArmyTeenPanel)\n",
