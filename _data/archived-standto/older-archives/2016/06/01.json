    "body": "##### Provided by U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center (USACRC) \n\n\n### What is it?\n\n \nThe Off-Duty Safety Awareness Presentation (ODSAP) is U.S. Army's highly informative safety presentation containing statistics, contributing factors, prevention tips and other relevant information regarding off-duty accidents. \n\nDeveloped for use at  battalion level and below, the presentation comes complete with embedded videos and speaker notes. The speaker notes may be used as is, or modified to fit a particular presentation style or reflect unit-specific accident trends.\n  \n\n### What has the Army done? \n\nThe ODSAP was originally developed in 2008 by the [U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center](https://safety.army.mil) to address an increase in fatal off-duty accidents. Annual updates to the presentation help ensure Soldiers are kept aware of the Army's most pressing off-duty safety issues. The materials and statistics contained in this presentation, titled \"Safety & Risk: Balance Through Awareness,\" enhance safety awareness for numerous off-duty activities as well as home safety, and address risky behaviors and the impact of fatigue and alcohol.\n \n \n### What continued efforts have been planned for the future?\n\nOff-duty safety awareness, coupled with the five-step risk management process, must be at the heart of every Soldier's plans. The ODSAP is an evolving set of materials, and user [feedback](mailto:usarmy.rucker.hqda-secarmy.list.safe-ground-task-for@mail.mil) is critical to the development of future revisions.\n \n### Why is this important to the Army? \n\nSafety is a cornerstone of Army readiness. It is imperative for all leaders, Soldiers and civilians to be able to achieve and sustain personal readiness. On average, the Army loses the equivalent of a company-sized formation in off-duty accidents each year which   affects the Army's readiness. Awareness and application of appropriate safety measures while involved in off-duty activities preserves lives and resources.\n \n\n### Resources:\n\n* [U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center](https://safety.army.mil)\n* [Off Duty Safety Awareness Presentation](https://safety.army.mil/OFF-DUTY/HomeandFamily/Off-DutySafetyAwarenessPresentation2016.aspx) \n \n#### Related STAND-TO!:\n* [Personnel Readiness Transformation](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2016-05-25)\n* [Army Readiness Guidance](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2016-05-19)\n* [R2: Risk Reduction and Safety](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-04-08) \n* [Army Safety and Occupational Health Objectives](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-12-24)\n\n\n\n",
