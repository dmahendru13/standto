These training products support [America's Army - Our Profession](http://cape.army.mil/aaop/), a professional development program that strengthens the Army Profession.\n\nThe fiscal year 2016 Army Profession campaign theme is \"Living the Army Ethic: Why and How We Serve.\" The [Army Ethic](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-06-15) is the heart of the Total Army and motivates the conduct of Soldiers and Army Civilians as Army professionals, bound together in a common moral purpose to support and defend the constitution and the American people.  \n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nIn addition to developing training support packages (TSPs) for the uniformed cohorts, CAPE recently developed an alternative lesson plan and TSP for Army Civilians that can be used separately for professional development or combined with the standard, recently updated TSP for combined audiences of Soldiers and Army Civilians.\n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nTraining support packages are helpful tools for leaders to use to support increased understanding of the different aspects of the Army Profession. This initiative is designed to provide Soldiers and Army Civilians with character development and educate them about the importance of incorporating the Army Ethic into their daily lives. For future annual themes, CAPE will develop TSPs that are integrated for Soldiers and Army Civilians.\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nThe Army Civilian Corps is a major component of the Army Profession and plays an integral role in accomplishing the Army's statutory missions. Individual readiness of both Soldiers and Army Civilians is the foundation of Army readiness.\n\nSoldiers and Army Civilians work together, building a ready and trained team to make a stronger Army. They also work together to develop and maintain the highest standards of character, competence and commitment. Professional development for both communities of practice builds mutual trust and understanding within the Army Profession.\n\n**Resources:** \n\n* [Mission Command Center of Excellence (MC CoE)](http://usacac.army.mil/organizations/mccoe)  \n* [U.S. Army Combined Arms Center](http://usacac.army.mil/ )\n* [The Center for the Army Profession and Ethic (CAPE) ]( \nhttp://cape.army.mil/)\n    * [Training Support Packages](http://cape.army.mil/tsp/)\n    * [CAPE Army Civilian Training and Education Products](http://cape.army.mil/civilians.php )\n* [U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) ](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/)\n* [AAOP Living the Army Ethic ](http://cape.army.mil/aaop/living-the-army-ethic/ )\n* [Character Development Project](http://cape.army.mil/character-development-project/)\n\n**Related documents:**\n\n* [Army Ethic White Paper](http://cape.army.mil/army-ethic-white-paper/ ) \n* [ALARACT 189/2014](http://cape.army.mil/repository/aaop/living-the-army-ethic/living-the-army-ethic-alaract.pdf )\n* [ADRP1: The Army Profession](http://armypubs.army.mil/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_a/pdf/adrp1.pdf)\n* [ADP1: The Army](http://armypubs.army.mil/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_a/pdf/adp1.pdf )\n\n**Related STAND-TO!:**\n\n* [Civilian Workforce Transformation](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-04-17/) \n* [Army Ethic](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-06-15/ )\n* [Army Leader Development Program](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-04-15/ ) \n\n\n",
