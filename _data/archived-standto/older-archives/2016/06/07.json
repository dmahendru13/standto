National Safety Month, sponsored by the nonprofit National Safety Council, offers Army leaders a prime opportunity to energize on accident prevention efforts and engage Soldiers on safety.  \n\n\n### What has the Army done? \n\nThe [U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center](https://safety.army.mil) launches an Army-wide campaign each year in the month of June to mark National Safety Month. This year's campaign focuses on the significance of safety in four key areas: off-duty driving, civilian injury prevention, and [ground](https://safety.army.mil/MEDIA/Knowledge/tabid/97/ArticleID/495/ArtMID/478/Preview.aspx) and [aviation](https://safety.army.mil/MEDIA/Knowledge/tabid/97/ArticleID/493/ArtMID/478/Preview.aspx) operations. \n\nNumerous online risk management tools and multimedia products are developed and refined to strengthen the current and future Army safety programs for use by leaders, Soldiers and safety professionals in the field, including:  \n\n* (1) [Army Readiness Assessment Program](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-10-27/)\n* (2) Army Risk Management Information System\n* (3) [Ground Risk Assessment Tool]( https://grat.safety.army.mil/ako_auth/grat/default.aspx) (CAC-log-in required) \n* (4) [Off-Duty Safety Awareness Presentation]( https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2016-06-01)\n* (5) [Preliminary Loss Reports](https://safety.army.mil/STATISTICS/PreliminaryLossReports.aspx)\n* (6) [Travel Risk Planning System](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-11-19/)\n* (7) [Driver's Training Toolbox](https://safety.army.mil/ON-DUTY/DriversTrainingToolbox.aspx)\n* (8) [Range & Weapons Safety Toolbox](https://safety.army.mil/ON-DUTY/RangeandWeaponsSafetyToolbox.aspx)\n* (9) [Knowledge Magazine](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-01-23/)\n* (10) [Seasonal/topical safety campaigns](https://safety.army.mil/MEDIA/SeasonalSafetyCampaigns.aspx)\n \n\nMedia products are made available on the [USACRC website](https://safety.army.mil).    \n \n### What continued efforts have been planned for the future?\n\nArmy Combat Readiness Center will continue to target efforts on safety and risk management issues affecting the entire Army. It will continue to provide supporting products and tools for users in the field. While the yearly campaigns may differ in topic areas or focus, materials will always be developed according to the Army's latest accident trends and risk mitigation initiatives.\n\n \n### Why is this important to the Army? \n\nThe spring and summer months are among the most dangerous times of year for Soldiers off duty, especially regarding accidents involving private motor vehicles, motorcycles and personal watercraft. Every day is critical when it comes to risk. Leaders, Soldiers, Family members and Army Civilians must work together to prevent needless losses within their formations. By using National Safety Month as a starting point for dialogue, leaders establish or enhance safety programs that pay dividends throughout the year, regardless of season.\nArmy Safe is Army Strong! \n\n### Resources:\n\n\n* [U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center](https://safety.army.mil)\n\n#### Messages: \n* [Army senior leaders tri-signed letter](https://www.army.mil/e2/downloads/rv7/standto/docs/2016_national_safety_month_trisign.pdf)\n* [Katherine Hammack, Assistant Secretary of the Army (Installations, Energy & Environment)](https://www.army.mil/article/167609)\n\n#### Related video: \n* [National Safety Month 2016](https://safety.army.mil/MEDIA/VideoLibrary/VideoPlayer/TabId/112/VideoId/311/National-Safety-Month-2016.aspx)\n\n#### Related STAND-TO!:\n* [FY16 Army Safety and Occupational Health Objectives](\nhttps://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-12-16/)\n\n\n\n\n",
