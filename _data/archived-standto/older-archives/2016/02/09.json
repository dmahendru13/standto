    "body": "#### *Hallowed Grounds: Sites of African-American Memories*\n\nDuring National African-American History Month, the Army pays tribute to the contributions of past and present generations of African Americans and reaffirms our commitment to keeping the American dream alive for every citizen. This year as we recognize *Hallowed Grounds: Sites of African-American Memories*, we reflect upon significant places where African-American history was made, particularly those places which are an important part of our Army's own history ...\n\nThe United States Army celebrates the important contributions African-American Soldiers and Civilians have made and continue to make in the building of our great Nation. Their stories represent the qualities of resilience and perseverance.  The many historic sites across America made famous by the actions of African Americans help chronicle those generations who fought for an America that truly reflects the ideals enshrined in our founding documents.\n\nDuring National African-American History Month, we encourage all Soldiers, Civilians, Veterans, and Family members to become more familiar with these historic landmarks where African American history was made. Let us celebrate the rich legacy of African Americans and honor their notable contributions that help make our Army what it is today-a place where people from all walks of life stand proudly together in service to our Nation.

They're the greatest Soldiers in the world. It's a real honor and humbling to be their chief of staff. \n\n### - [Chief of Staff of the Army Gen. Mark A.
