    "body": "### What is it?\n\n[*That Guy*](http://www.thatguy.com/) is a research-based binge drinking prevention marketing campaign that uses [evidence-based practices](http://www.nap.edu/read/13441/chapter/15#308) and a peer-to-peer communications strategy to highlight the short-term, social and reputational consequences of excessive drinking. This campaign was launched by the Department of Defense (DOD)/[Defense Health Agency](http://www.tricare.mil/alcoholawareness) (DHA) in 2006. This campaign is a unique tool in the DOD prevention toolbox as it is specifically designed to help prevent excessive drinking among 18-24 year-old junior enlisted military personnel.\n\nThis campaign's prevention-focused marketing materials are available at no cost to DOD installations and can be ordered at the [Resources page](http://www.thatguy.com/Resources) on the *That Guy* website. This site includes [instructions on effectively implementing the campaign](http://resources.thatguy.com/get-started). \n\n### What has the Army done?\n\n*That Guy* has been implemented at every major DOD installation across the globe, and ongoing research is conducted with junior service members to ensure that the campaign remains effective and relevant. The Army's MWR/[Better Opportunities for Single Soldiers](http://www.armymwr.com/recleisure/single/boss.aspx) (BOSS) program takes an active leadership role in [implementing the campaign](http://www.army.mil/article/28358/) given its peer-to-peer focus. *That Guy* is also a featured resource on the [Army Substance Abuse Program (ASAP)](https://acsap.army.mil/public/facts/that-guy.jsp) website and *That Guy* campaign representatives have briefed leadership and department-level point of contacts at scores of Army installations to promote and sustain this effort. \n\nAccording to the 2012 DMDC Status of Forces Survey, awareness of *That Guy* among E1-E4 service members was 64 percent, an all-time high. In addition, an analysis of the 2008 DOD Health Related Behaviors [Survey](http://thatguy.com/newsletter/november2014/) (HRBS) indicated a statistical correlation between *That Guy* campaign implementation and lower rates of binge drinking at participating DOD installations. Within the Army, the analysis also indicated a lower rate of binge drinking, overall, among junior enlisted males relative to the 2005 HRBS. \n\nIn 2015, the *That Guy* campaign was recognized with a [first place award](http://www.nagconline.org/Awards/documents/NAGC-2015-Awards-Presentation.pdf) from the  National Association of Government Communicators in the *promotional campaigns* category.\n\n### What does the Army have planned for the future?\n\nSince 2013, the [Defense Health Agency](http://www.health.mil/dha) has been executing, in collaboration with the Army, two large-scale evaluation studies that further explore the impact of the *That Guy* campaign. Results from the first study are currently being analyzed and appear promising.\n\n### Why is it important to the Army?\n\nBinge drinking is ultimately a force readiness issue as it is associated with a number of [additional health and behavioral problems](http://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/binge-drinking.htm) including sexual assaults, domestic violence, suicide, and motor vehicle accidents. \n\n\n### Resources:\n\n* [Defense Health Agency](http://www.health.mil/dha)\n* For junior servicemembers: [ThatGuy.com](http://www.thatguy.com) \n* For POCs to order materials at no cost: [Resources](http://www.thatguy.com/resources)\n* [Contact *That Guy* campaign](mailto:info@thatguy.com) \n* [Army Substance Abuse Program (ASAP)](https://acsap.army.mil/public/facts/that-guy.jsp)\n\n#### That Guy campaign on social media: \n* [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/ThatGuy)\n* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/thatguyvideos)\n* [*Buzzed* Mobile Game](http://thatguy.com/buzzed/) (free download on Apple and Android devices) \n\n#### Related articles: \n* [Don't be *That Guy*](http://www.army.mil/article/28358/)\n* [Substance Use Disorders in the U.S. Armed Forces (2013)](http://www.nap.edu/read/13441/chapter/15#308)\n* [CDC Binge Drinking Fact Sheet](http://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/binge-drinking.htm)\n\n#### Related STAND-TO!: \n* [Army Readiness Assessment Program](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-10-27/ )\n* [Army Substance Abuse Program - Synthetic Stimulant Use](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-02-20/)\n* [BOSS Safety Factor](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/2010/10/12/) \n\n",
