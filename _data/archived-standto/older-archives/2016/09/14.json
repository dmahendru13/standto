Unified Quest 2016, managed by Army Training and Doctrine Command's [Army Capabilities Integration Center](http://www.arcic.army.mil/) - Future Warfare Division, helps senior Army leaders understand, visualize, describe, direct, lead and assess critical changes to the future operational environment and their implications for the future force.\n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nAmong other achievements, previous Unified Quest future studies resulted in the publication of TRADOC Pamphlet 525-5-500, \"Commanders Appreciation and Campaign Design,\" and revisions to the Army Capstone Concepts, [Army 2020 narrative](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-03-27) and required capabilities development. \n\n**What continued efforts are planned for the future?**\n\nUnified Quest 2016 and 2017 focus on developing a common understanding of the 2030-2050 future operational environment. Through this understanding, the Army will develop concepts for how the Army, along with its joint, inter-organizational and multinational partners, could fight in the future operating environment. The future study plan will also identify the characteristics, attributes, and required capabilities and opportunities of the future force under realistic scenarios.\n\nDuring May's Deep Future Wargame, study participants developed initial projections of the 2030-2050 operational environment, an assessment of the sources of military power with respect to threats and missions, and implications for Army and military operations. This information will be used to develop draft chapters of TRADOC Pamphlet 525-5-300, \"Vision of Future Conflict 2050.\"\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nUnified Quest provides a venue for the Army to explore a wide range of possible futures, generate innovative ideas, and consider how to integrate new capabilities into doctrine, operations, and force structure. Unified Quest does this by using a resource-informed perspective that is not limited by the resource constraints that typically drive near-term planning and programming.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [Unified Quest website](http://www.arcic.army.mil/Initiatives/UnifiedQuest)\n* [Army Warfighting Challenges website](http://www.arcic.army.mil/Initiatives/ArmyWarfightingChallenges)\n* [Army Training and Doctrine Command](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/)\n\n**Related documents:**\n\n* [TRADOC Pamphlet 525-5-500, \"Commanders Appreciation and Campaign Design\"](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/tpubs/pams/p525-5-500.pdf)\n* [TRADOC Pamphlet 525-3-1, \"Army Capstone Concepts\"](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/tpubs/pams/tp525-3-1.pdf)\n\n**Related STAND-TO!:**\n\n* [The U.S. Army Operating Concept](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-12-22)",
