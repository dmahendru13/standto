The campaign, which runs through Labor Day in September, emphasizes prevention and vigilance and is driven by a theme asking all audiences to make safe decisions wherever their adventures take them. \n\nMultimedia products, including feature articles, posters and videos covering topics such as [boating and watercraft safety](https://safety.army.mil/OFF-DUTY/SportsandRecreation/WaterSafety.aspx), [maintenance safety](https://safety.army.mil/ON-DUTY/GovernmentMotorVehicle/Maintenance.aspx), [heat injury prevention](https://phc.amedd.army.mil/topics/discond/hipss/Pages/HeatInjuryPrevention.aspx), fatigue awareness, [motorcycle safety awareness](https://safety.army.mil/OFF-DUTY/PMV-2.aspx), driving under the influence and [distracted driving](https://safety.army.mil/OFF-DUTY/PMV-4/DistractedDriving.aspx) and more are available through the [campaign website](https://safety.army.mil/MEDIA/SeasonalSafetyCampaigns/SpringSummer2017.aspx). \n\n**What continued efforts are planned for the future?**\n\nHistorically, spring and summer are the most deadly seasons for Army accidents, with notable increases in off-duty fatalities.\n\nAlthough rising temperatures and seasonal activities present persistent challenges for the Army team, proactive risk management tactics will help mitigate hazards and prevent needless loss.\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nThe Army team must remain watchful of the increased hazards associated with spring and summer and stay engaged throughout this high-risk period. The USACRC produces two seasonal campaigns per year, Army Safe Spring/Summer and Army Safe Fall/Winter, to heighten awareness of the unique seasonal risks associated with on-duty and off-duty activities. \n\nSoldier safety is paramount. When accidents take the lives of Soldiers, they also take strength from the battlefield and degrade combat readiness.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center](https://safety.army.mil/)\n* [Seasonal Safety campaigns](https://safety.army.mil/MEDIA/SeasonalSafetyCampaigns.aspx)\n\n**Related STAND-TO!:**\n\n* [Army Safety Online Tools and Initiatives](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2016-10-25)\n* [Motorcycle Mentorship Program](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2016-04-28)\n\n\n**USACRC on Social Media:**\n\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ArmySafety/)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SafetyCenter)\n* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/USArmySafety)\n* [Knowledge Magazine](https://safety.army.mil/MEDIA/Knowledge.aspx)\n",
