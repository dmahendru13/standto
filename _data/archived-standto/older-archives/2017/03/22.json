    "body": "#######Provided by U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command's Institute for Noncommissioned Officer Professional Development \n\n**What is it?**\n\nThe [Noncommissioned Officer 2020 (NCO 2020) Strategy](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/FrontPageContent/Docs/NCO2020.pdf) provides vision and guidance on the ends, ways and means for developing NCOs who are prepared for the challenges of an uncertain future.\n\nLed by U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command's [Institute for Noncommissioned Officer Professional Development](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/INCOPD/index.html), NCO 2020 Strategy changes the Noncommissioned Officer Education System, or NCOES, into the NCO Professional Development System, or NCOPDS, as described in the Headquarters Department of the Army Execution Order 236-15, Army-Wide Implementation of Non-Commissioned Officer Professional Development System.\n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nTRADOC developed the NCO 2020 Strategy based on a data-driven, analytical assessment process that examined the current NCO development model. This strategy is also aligned with the current [Army Leader Development Strategy](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-06-19) and [Army Leader Requirements Model](http://wct.army.mil/modules/soldier/s8-evaluations.html). NCO 2020 focuses on building core leader competencies in the NCO Corps to include effective communication, training skills and professional development across all leadership levels. \n\nNCO 2020 requires that all leaders understand their responsibility for developing the current and next generation of NCOs. These efforts place an emphasis on providing NCOs with the outstanding training, education and experiences they will need to conduct complex missions in the future. Leaders must also emphasize career-long learning as essential to Soldier development and force readiness.\n\n**What continued efforts are planned for the future?**\n\nTo achieve the desired strategic ends, the NCOES must fundamentally change and evolve into a comprehensive leader development process that links training, education and experiences spanning the operational, institutional and self-development learning domains. \n\nThe NCO 2020 Strategy is organized into three efforts: development, talent management and stewardship of the profession. In February, the Army approved Fragmentary Order 4 to the Army Execution Order 236-15, which provides updates to the third effort of the NCO 2020 Strategy. \n\nTo educate the force on these updates, TRADOC will conduct the fourth State of NCO Development Town Hall, scheduled for March 30 at 11 a.m. EDT. During the town hall, subject matter experts from across the force will discuss the following topics, followed by Q&A sessions: \n\n* The future of the Army.\n* Expert Action Badge.\n* [Occupational Physical Assessment Test](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2016-03-28).\n* Character development.\n* [Not In My Squad](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-06-09).\n* Improving written and oral communication skills in professional military education.\n* Unit Noncommissioned Officer Development Program.\n* The Year of the NCO.\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nLeader development is fundamental to U.S. Army readiness. NCO 2020 is revolutionizing how the Army develops NCOs by setting conditions for better academic rigor and relevancy, self-awareness, and Soldier professional development. The overarching strategy will also lead to increasing levels of NCO readiness and competencies.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/)\n* [Institute for Noncommissioned Officer Professional Development](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/INCOPD/index.html)\n\n**Related documents:**\n\n* [NCO 2020 Strategy](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/FrontPageContent/Docs/NCO2020.pdf)\n* [TRADOC Pam 525-8-2: The U.S. Army Learning Concept](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/tpubs/pams/tp525-8-2.pdf)\n\n**Related STAND-TO!**\n\n* [NCO Evaluation Report](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-12-01)\n* [Select-Train-Educate-Promote (STEP)](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-08-24)\n* [The Army Learning Concept - 2015](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/2010/10/19)\n* [Army Leader Development Strategy 2013](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-06-19)\n* [ADRP 6-22 Army Leadership](http://armypubs.army.mil/ProductMaps/PubForm/ADRP.aspx)\n\n**Related blog post:** \n\n* [Straight from the CSM](http://www.tradocnews.org/category/straight-from-the-csm/)\n\n**Related articles:**\n\n* [7 Changes to NCO Development](http://www.tradocnews.org/7-changes-to-army-nco-professional-development/)\n* [STEP provides noncommissioned officers roadmap to promotion](http://www.army.mil/article/162606)\n\n",
