The PaYS program provides America's youth with the unique opportunity to simultaneously serve their country and prepare for their future.\n\nCorporations, companies, and public sector agencies that sign the PaYS partnership agreement are incorporated into community-based grassroots programs and are informed and motivated Army advocates. PaYS partners participate in these events to positively impact local perceptions of the Army and help to build a more favorable environment for the Army's brand.\n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nA total of 644 companies and government agencies have established a partnership with the Army through the PaYS program since its inception in July 2000. Since that time, the PaYS program has connected 202,562 active-duty Soldiers, 41,201 Army Reserve Soldiers, 2,241 regular Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) cadets and 598 Army Reserve ROTC cadets to potential employers. The PaYS program celebrated its 644th partnership with Indue Sales and Services, Inc. on Feb. 10.\n\n**What continued efforts are planned for the future?**\n\n* The Army plans to continue synchronizing transition efforts in order to successfully support active and Reserve component Soldiers as they move to the civilian sector. This plan will enable Soldiers to become career-ready while providing them with continuity of service where feasible.\n\n* The Army provides transition, education, and career counseling throughout the military life cycle.\n\n* The Army drives transition preparation and connection efforts to PaYS partnerships, apprenticeship, [Credentialing Opportunities On-Line (COOL)](https://www.cool.army.mil/index.htm), [on-the-job training programs](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/onthejob_apprenticeship.asp), internships, and job-shadowing programs.\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\n\nThe PaYS program is a strategic partnership between the Army and a cross section of private industry, academia, businesses and state and local public institutes.\n\nThe PaYS program supports:\n \n* The [Veterans Opportunity to Work Act](http://www.benefits.va.gov/vow/) in providing employment opportunities for veterans. \n* The Army's mission to [recruit](http://www.usarec.army.mil/aboutus.html), with integrity, high-quality men and women, connect America with its Army and positively impact perceptions of the Army to build a more favorable environment to the Army's brand. \n\nSoldiers who participate in the program develop valuable skills and experiences, in addition to gaining opportunities for employment with organizations that understand the value of their military service. This partnership connection provides a win-win situation for all. \n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [U.S. Army Partnership for Youth Success](https://www.armypays.com/)\n* [The Assistant Secretary of the Army (ASA) Manpower & Reserve Affairs (M&RA)](http://www.asamra.army.mil/)\n* [Army Marketing Research Group ](http://www.asamra.army.mil/org_amrg.cfm)\n* [Soldier for Life](https://soldierforlife.army.mil/)\n* [U.S. Army Ready and Resilient](https://www.army.mil/readyandresilient/)\n* [Army COOL: Credentialing Opportunities On-Line](https://www.cool.army.mil/index.htm)\n\n**Related STAND-TO!**\n\n* [Soldier for Life](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-01-17/)\n* [Ready and Resilient Campaign](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-07-15/)\n* [Credentialing](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-07-29/?)\n\n**Social media:**\n\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/armypays)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ArmyPaYS)\n* [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/ArmyPaYS)\n* [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/us-army-partnership-for-youth-success-pays-program?trk=top_nav_home)\n* [Instagram](https://instagram.com/armypaysprogram/)\n* [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/armypays/)",
