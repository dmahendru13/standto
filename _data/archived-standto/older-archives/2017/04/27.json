[U.S. Army Africa](http://www.usaraf.army.mil/) leverages its relationships across Africa to provide a venue for military and civilian planners to come together and find innovative solutions to providing for a more secure future in the region.\n\n**What continued efforts are planned for the future?**\n\nU.S. Army Africa leverages the Total Army and uses a regional focus, embedded in the Army's global engagement strategy to strengthen African land forces and regional organizations. These foundational capabilities help synchronize efforts and provide options to prevent conflict, shape the security environment and win conflicts. This exercise is just one example of U.S. Army Africa's commitment to strengthening relationships with partner nations in Africa. Future exercises and security-cooperation engagements will be scheduled to take place in Africa, and U.S. Army Africa will continue to develop and build upon the relationships and partnerships established here.\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nThe African continent is a complex environment with over one billion people and more than 2,000 spoken languages in a continent three times the size of the U.S. The importance of building partnerships across Africa is more relevant than ever in light of the growth of regional and transnational violent extremist organizations (VEOs).\n\nUnified Focus brings together the Lake Chad Basin and international community and represents a unified approach to confronting regional and continental challenges such as VEOs and illicit trafficking.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [U.S. Army Africa](http://www.usaraf.army.mil/)\n* [U.S. Africa Command](http://www.africom.mil/)\n\n**Related STAND-TO!**\n\n* [Global Landpower Network in Africa](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2016-09-28)\n\n**Related articles**\n\n* [Multinational planners put final touches on Exercise Unified Focus 2017 in Cameroon](https://www.army.mil/article/183258/multinational_planners_put_final_touches_on_exercise_unified_focus_2017_in_cameroon)\n* [Cameroon hosts multinational planning event for exercise Unified Focus 2017](https://www.army.mil/article/186145/)\n* [Exercise Unified Focus 2017 plan takes shape in Cameroon](https://www.army.mil/article/186144/)\n\n**Social media:**\n\n* [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/ArmyAfrica)\n* [Twitter: @USArmyAfrica](https://twitter.com/USArmyAfrica)\n* [Unified Focus 17 Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/usarmyafrica/sets/72157675316089786)",
