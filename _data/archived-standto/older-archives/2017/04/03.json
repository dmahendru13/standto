Throughout the month of April, Army organizations will provide a variety of fun and exciting events such as family fun nights, parades, festivals, and special luncheons to officially recognize military children. \n\nMonth of the Military Child activities will differ across DOD and the Army, but all share a common goal: to celebrate and recognize the contributions of military children.\n\nSpecial events include the Young Lives, Big Stories contest, where military children are invited to share their experiences and win prizes, and [Operation Megaphone](http://www.facebook.com/OpMegaphone), where military teens join with others in a worldwide lock-in scheduled for April 28 and 29.\n\n**What continued efforts are planned for the future?**\n\nAs the nation prepares for the future, the Army recognizes that children will continue to experience and work through the challenges of relocations, deployments, reintegration and, if needed, care for their wounded Soldier parent. \n\nThrough specialized programs and trained staff, the Army will continue to anticipate and address the evolving needs of Soldiers and Families to ensure they are healthy, ready, and self-reliant.\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nThere are more than 133,000 children and youth registered in 69 child and youth services programs. The Army remains committed to these military Family members to honor the service and sacrifices of those who serve the nation. Month of the military child is one way the Army can recognize, applaud, and celebrate the resilience of military children and youth and their role in ensuring a ready force now and into the future.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [Army.mil: U.S. Army Families](http://www.army.mil/families)\n* [U.S. Army Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation](http://www.armymwr.com/momc)\n* [U.S. Army Installation Management Command](http://www.imcom.army.mil)\n* [Military Kids Connect](http://militarykidsconnect.dcoe.mil)\n* [Military OneSource](http://www.militaryonesource.mil) or call 1-800-342-9647.\n\n**Related social media:**\n\n* [IMCOM on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/InstallationManagementCommunity)\n* [IMCOM on Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/armyimcom)\n* [Army MWR on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/FamilyMWR)\n* [Army MWR on Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/FamilyMWR)\n* [Army Teen Panel on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ArmyTeenPanel)",
