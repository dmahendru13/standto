Character development requires an [Army culture of trust](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2016-01-27 ), professional climates in Army organizations and individual commitment to embrace a shared identity as *trusted Army professionals*.  \n\n**What is the Army doing?**\n\nIn 2015, the Army noted that a capabilities gap existed in the [*Army Human Dimension Strategy*](http://usacac.army.mil/sites/default/files/publications/20150524_Human_Dimension_Strategy_vr_Signature_WM_1.pdf). The Army lacked a consensus and disciplined approach to developing character, prompting research and assessment of current Army efforts in character development. *The Army's Framework for Character Development* describes what must be done to provide for character development within the process of leader development.   \n\nStrategic leaders, through their directives, policies and programs, strengthen the Army culture of trust. Organizational leaders certify that standards are met within professional climates. Direct leaders live by and uphold the [Army Ethic](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-06-15/) and inspire, teach, coach, counsel, mentor and build mutual trust and cohesive teamwork.  \n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nIn fiscal year 2018, the Army will implement the framework through a planned set of eight initiatives, ranging from inclusion of character and trust concepts in education and doctrine to development of an assessment process to determine the degree to which the framework is having the intended effect. This mission is a top policy priority and will be managed through the Army Profession and Leader Development Forum.    \n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nThe Army must be able to *fight and win the nation's wars*  in the right way. Successful implementation of the character development framework supports mission command. This framework contributes to warfighting readiness by strengthening mutual trust and cohesion within the Army and with the American people.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [The Center for the Army Profession and Ethic (CAPE)](http://cape.army.mil/)\n* [The Army Character Development Project](http://cape.army.mil/character-development-project/)\n\n\n**Related documents:**\n\n* Army white paper: [*The Army's Framework for Character Development,*](http://data.cape.army.mil/web/repository/white-papers/armys-framework-for-character-development-white-paper.pdf)\n* Army White Paper: [*Developing the Character of Trusted Army Professionals, Forging the Way Ahead*](http://cape.army.mil/repository/white-papers/character-development-white-paper.pdf) \n* [Army Leader Development Strategy](https://go.usa.gov/xnK9w )\n* [ADRP1: The Army Profession](https://go.usa.gov/xn26k)\n* [TRADOC PAM 525-3-3: *The U.S. Army Functional Concept for Mission Command*]( \nhttp://www.tradoc.army.mil/tpubs/pams/TP525-3-3.pdf)\n* [The Army Human Dimension Strategy 2015](\nhttp://usacac.army.mil/sites/default/files/publications/20150524_Human_Dimension_Strategy_vr_Signature_WM_1.pdf)\n\n**Related STAND-TO!:**\n\n* [Character Development Project](https://www.army.mil/standto/2016-08-10) \n* [Army Ethic](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-06-15/) \n* [Army culture of trust](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2016-01-27)\n* [Army Leader Development Strategy 2013](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-06-19)\n",
