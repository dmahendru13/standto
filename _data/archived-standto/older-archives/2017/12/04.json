The two teams met for the first time at West Point on November 29, 1890.  The game has come to embody the spirit of the interservice sports rivalry of the United States Armed Forces.\n\nThis year marks the 118th Army-Navy game. The game scripts the end of the college football regular season and the third and final game of the season's Commander-in-Chief's Trophy series.\n\n**What is the Army doing?**\n \nCompetitive sport is an important part of developing leaders at West Point. It prepares cadets for the challenges they face as officers. Experiences on the field help cadet-athletes to go on to perform admirably in austere environments around the globe.  These experiences instill tenacity, resilience, discipline, mental and physical toughness, and the desire to excel. \n \n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nThe Army's greatest asset is its people. USMA graduates will lead the Army's future formations. The Army will continue to instill strong foundations of value-based leadership skills and professional competence in cadets. This foundation will apply with equal effectiveness across a broad spectrum of complex operations. The event's goals are to: \n\n* Attract, retain and sustain quality leaders\n* Broaden understanding and advocacy by gaining and maintaining well-informed publics\n* Build camaraderie within the services in support of the Army team -- America's team\n  \n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nThe Army-Navy game is recognized as the greatest rivalry in sports, however, both fight as a joint force for the nation. \n\n This game connects the [U.S. Military Academy at West Point](https://www.army.mil/standto/2017-11-21) and the Army with the American people to help bridge the civil-military gap through sports. As a preeminent military institution the academy focuses on the leader and character development objectives: \n\n* Live honorably internalized the values of *Duty, Honor, Country*\n* Build a culture of excellence and winning\n* Recognize and leverage the power of diverse teams\n* Inculcating the values of the Army\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [U.S. Military Academy at West Point](http://www.westpoint.edu/)\n* [Army West Point Sports](http://www.goarmywestpoint.com/)\n* Army.mil: [WestPoint News](https://www.army.mil/westpoint)\n\n**Related documents:**\n\n* [USMA Strategic Plan 2015-2021](http://go.usa.gov/3eN4B)\n* [Character Development Strategy](http://go.usa.gov/3eQSY)\n* [West Point Leader Development System Handbook](http://go.usa.gov/3eQJT)\n\n**Related STAND-TO!:**\n\n* [U.S. Military Academy at West Point](https://www.army.mil/standto/2017-11-21)\n\n**USMA-West Point on social media:**\n\n* [Facebook: West Point](http://www.facebook.com/WestPointUSMA)\n* [Facebook: West Point Parents](http://www.facebook.com/westpointparents)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/westpoint_usma)\n",
