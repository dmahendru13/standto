In accordance with [DODI 1000.29](http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/100029p.pdf), the Army has established a proactive program for civil liberties that meets Department of Defense requirements. This future revision will include Army policy for Army activities and training requirements.\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nThe Army Privacy Program, [AR 25-22](http://www.apd.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/pdf/web/AR25-22_Web_FINAL.pdf), sets forth policies and procedures that govern personal information kept by the Department of the Army in [Privacy Act Systems of Records](https://www.rmda.army.mil/privacy/sorns/index.html). This regulation also provides general guidance on collecting, safeguarding, and disclosing personal information, and promotes uniformity within the Army's Privacy Program. It is essential for the Army to build awareness at all levels to promote and protect privacy and civil liberties of all who are touched by the Army mission.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [Records Management and Declassification Agency](https://www.rmda.army.mil/RMDA/RMDA.html)\n* [Privacy Act System of Records Notice](https://www.rmda.army.mil/privacy/sorns/)\n* [The Army Civil Liberties Program](https://www.rmda.army.mil/civil-liberties/RMDA-CL-Division.html)\n* [CIO/G-6: Privacy Impact Assessments](http://ciog6.army.mil/privacyimpactassessments/tabid/71/default.aspx)\n\n**Related document:**\n\n* [AR 25-22, Army Privacy Program](http://www.apd.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/pdf/web/AR25-22_Web_FINAL.pdf)\n* [DODI 1000.29](http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/100029p.pdf)",
