National Engineers Week provides an opportunity to the nation to:\n\n* Recognize achievements in the engineering profession.\n* Improve understanding of engineering around us.\n* Encourage more children and young adults to pursue engineering.\n* Promote professional development of engineers.\n\n**What is the Army doing?**\n\nNational Engineers Week is an important annual observance for the [U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)](http://www.usace.army.mil/) and is celebrated Feb 18 to 25 this year. \n\n* USACE's [Civil Works](http://www.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works/) mission provides a key foundational component of the nation's public infrastructure that facilitates economic growth, quality of life, environmental health and national security.\n\n* The USACE [Military Missions](http://www.usace.army.mil/Missions/Military-Missions/) program matches capabilities to combatant command requirements to develop efficient and effective solutions to support the three pillars underpinning the National Security Strategy: diplomacy, defense and development. \n\n* USACE has one of the largest [environmental](http://www.usace.army.mil/Missions/Environmental/) restoration and environmental sustainability roles in the federal government, supporting our interservice and [interagency](http://www.usace.army.mil/Missions/Military-Missions/Interagency-International-Support/) partners in achieving their goals for environmental compliance and cleanup.\n\n* USACE is the nation's largest federal provider of outdoor recreation, managing more than 400 lake and river projects in 43 states and hosting more than 370 million visits per year, providing a diverse range of outdoor activities close to home and to people of all ages.\n\n* To help address the nation's [STEM](http://www.usace.army.mil/STEM/) challenge, USACE employees participate in mentorship programs, science fairs, robotics competitions, teacher-training workshops, recreational events, STEM camps and other educational opportunities.\n\n* Total USACE obligations in FY16 were $27.1 billion, comparable to No. 103 on the Fortune 500 list.\n\n**What continued efforts are planned for the future?**\n\nThe history of America is the history of the Corps of Engineers. [Army engineers](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-02-27) continue to play a crucial role in the growth and welfare of the nation by solving the toughest engineering challenges. With sustainability as a guiding principle, the disciplined USACE team works diligently to strengthen the nation's security by building and maintaining America's water resources infrastructure and providing military facilities where service members train, work and live.\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nArmy engineers deliver facilities and infrastructure to help the armed forces maintain readiness, achieve Army modernization goals, and support U.S. defense and security assistance goals worldwide.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [U.S. Army Corps of Engineers](http://www.usace.army.mil/)\n* [U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: A Brief History](http://www.usace.army.mil/About/History/BriefHistoryoftheCorps.aspx)\n* [U.S. Army Engineer School and Regiment](http://www.wood.army.mil/usaes/)\n* [Go Army: Engineering](http://www.goarmy.com/careers-and-jobs/about-army-stem/engineering-jobs.html)\n\n**Related STAND-TO!:**\n\n* [The Nation's Water Resources Infrastructure](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-05-22)\n* [Support in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-07-08)\n* [Interagency and International Services Program](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-08-05)\n* [Army Engineers](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-02-27)\n* [U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-12-10)\n* [Regional Power Mission Exercises](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2016-07-07)\n* [Forecast Informed Reservoir Operations](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2016-07-26)\n\n**Social media:**\n\n* [USACE on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/USACEHQ/)\n* [Twitter (@USACEHQ)](https://twitter.com/USACEHQ)",
