MCCoE was established on Dec. 6, 2010.\n\nThe MCCoE serves as a warfighting function lead and Department of the Army force modernization proponent for mission command. \n\nThe MCCoE is comprised of seven organizations:\n\n* [Combined Arms Doctrine Directorate](http://usacac.army.mil/organizations/mccoe/cadd)\n* [Center for Army Leadership](http://usacac.army.mil/organizations/mccoe/cal)\n* [Center for the Army Profession and Ethic](http://cape.army.mil/)\n* [Center for Army Lessons Learned](http://usacac.army.mil/organizations/mccoe/call)\n* [Capability Development Integration Directorate](http://usacac.army.mil/organizations/mccoe/cdid)\n* [Mission Command Directorate of Training](http://usacac.army.mil/organizations/mccoe/dots)\n* [Force Modernization Proponent Center](http://usacac.army.mil/organizations/mccoe/fmpc)\n\n**What is the Army doing?**\n\nThe MCCoE works with other centers of excellence and stakeholders to develop and improve doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, facilities and policy capabilities to enhance force effectiveness. The MCCoE trains annually nearly 1,000 Soldiers and Army civilians through four training courses: \n\n* [Mission Command Digital Master Gunner Course](http://usacac.army.mil/organizations/mccoe/dots/mission-command-master-gunner)\n* [Knowledge Management Qualification Course](https://combinedarmscenter.army.mil/orgs/mccoe/FMPC/akmp_x/default.aspx)\n* [Information Operations Qualification Course](http://usacac.army.mil/organizations/mccoe/iop/rcfactsheet)\n* [Lessons Learned Course](http://usacac.army.mil/organizations/mccoe/call/ll-course)\n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nDuring 2018, the MCCoE will further develop and experiment with the [Echelons Above Brigade](https://go.usa.gov/xnWpP) (EAB) concept about how a future division, corps and Army service component headquarters will function as tactical/operational headquarters in large-scale combat operations.\n\nThe MCCoE will support efforts to streamline the improvement and modernization of the Army's mission command network so that it's easier for Soldiers, units and the Army's mission partners to exchange information. The MCCoE will collaborate with other Army organizations to simplify hardware, software and systems in command posts to improve their mobility, survivability and interoperability. \n \n   \n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n \nAfter a 15-year focus on war in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U. S. Army has shifted its number one priority to readiness -- to prevent and deter conflict and to prevail and win should conflict occur. Within one single organization, the MCCoE helps the Army to:\n\n* develop leaders to exercise mission command\n* produce the best doctrine possible in a timely manner\n* strengthen America's Army as a military profession\n* share the Army's lessons and best practices across the force\n* integrate and synchronize delivery of mission command training and education solutions\n* manage current capabilities and analyze future requirements for the Army\n\nMCCoE fulfills its mission to ensure the Army remains the best-trained, manned and equipped force while being an effective steward of its resources.  \n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [U.S. Army Mission Command Center of Excellence](http://usacac.army.mil/organizations/mccoe)\n* [U.S. Army Combined Arms Center](http://usacac.army.mil)\n* [U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/ )\n \n\n**Related documents:**\n\n* [Field Manual 6-0, Commander and Staff Organization and Operations](https://go.usa.gov/xnWpS)   \n* [Army Doctrine Publication 6-0, Mission Command]( https://go.usa.gov/xnWda) \n* [Mission Command Digital Master Gunner Course](https://go.usa.gov/xnWdg)\n* [Knowledge Management Qualification Course](https://go.usa.gov/xnWd2)  \n* [Information Operations Qualification Course](https://go.usa.gov/xnWdZ) \n* [Lessons Learned Course](https://go.usa.gov/xnWdB) \n\n**Related STAND-TO!:**\n\n* [Readiness](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2017-10-04 )\n* [Army Readiness Guidance ](https://www.army.mil/standto/2016-05-19)\n* [Mission Command Digital Master Gunner](www.army.mil/standto/archive_2016-05-17)\n* [Mission Command Strategy](www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-09-18/)    \n",

This is the essence of the Army's concept of mission command empowering leaders with the \"why\" of their task, but leaving the 'how' to their imagination. \n\n\\- Chief of Staff of the Army Gen.
