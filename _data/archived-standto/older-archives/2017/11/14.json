Social media platforms provide an opportunity for transparent communication and two-way engagement with the public. Social media has become an important way to explain Army missions.\n\nThe [Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) 8550.01](http://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodi/855001p.pdf), released Sept. 11, 2012, provides high-level guidelines for military use of social media. The instruction acknowledges that Internet-based capabilities are integral to operations across the Department of Defense. \n\n**What is the Army doing?**\n\nThe Army understands the importance of social media and encourages commands, Soldiers, Families, and Army Civilians to safely and accurately use social media to share their experiences and provide information. The [Office of the Chief of Public Affairs](https://www.army.mil/info/institution/publicAffairs/)' Digital Media Division (DMD), originally launched as Online Social Media Division in January 2009, manages the Army's primary social media presences on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram.\n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nThe Army will keep pace with the advances in technology, including the increased use of mobile devices to maintain the trust and confidence of the American people. OCPA will continue to educate Army public affairs specialists on effective use of social media and help them to become effective communicators and representatives of the Army - creating an environment where trusted information is disseminated to the public. \n\nOCPA will continue to shape its social media strategy while exploring and evaluating new and innovative digital platforms for educating audiences about the Army.   \n\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nThe Army understands the power of social media and uses it effectively to communicate, engage and empower Army supporters to keep the American public informed. During a time of crisis, social media presents an important way to provide timely and accurate information that is easily-accessible, cost-effective and immediate. Social media helps the Army to create meaningful connections with its audience, which maintains their trust and confidence in America's Army. \n \n**Resources:**\n\n* [U.S. Army Social Media](https://www.army.mil/socialmedia?from=st)\n* [Army Social Media Registry](https://www.army.mil/socialmedia/directory?from_st)\n* [Office of the Chief of Public Affairs](https://www.army.mil/info/institution/publicAffairs?from=st)\n* [Army Criminal Investigation Command](http://www.cid.army.mil/)\n\n**Related documents:**\n\n* [ALARACT](https://www.army.mil/e2/downloads/rv7/socialmedia/alaract_014_2017_professionalization_of_online_conduct.pdf)\n* [DOD Instruction Number 8550.01, *DoD Internet Services and Internet-Based Capabilities.*](http://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodi/855001p.pdf)\n* [Army Criminal Investigation Command - Social Networking Safety Tips](http://www.cid.army.mil/assets/docs/2can/SocialNetworkingSafetyTips.pdf)\n* [AR 600-20 - Army Command Policy](http://www.apd.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/pdf/web/r600_20.pdf)\n\n**Related STAND-TO!:**\n\n* [Army Social Media Resources](https://www.army.mil/standto/2017-05-18)\n* [Online Conduct - Think, Type, Post](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-06-16)\n\n**Army on social media:**\n\n* [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/USArmy)\n* [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/USArmy)\n* [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/usarmy) \n* [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/soldiersmediacenter/)\n* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/usarmy)\n",
