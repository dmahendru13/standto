On May 5, 2017, continuing the effort to inform and educate, the Army launched a new [social media microsite](https://www.army.mil/socialmedia?from=st1) for [social media managers](https://www.army.mil/socialmedia/managers/?from=st), [Soldiers, Families](https://www.army.mil/socialmedia/soldiers/?from=st), and Army Civilians who communicate using organizational, professional and personal social media accounts.   \n \n**What is the Army doing?**\n\n[Office of the Chief of Public Affairs'](https://www.army.mil/info/institution/publicAffairs/?from=st1) Digital Media Division created the [Army Social Media microsite](https://www.army.mil/socialmedia?from=st2) to replace the previous 'Social Media Handbook' PDF. The new site provides policies, guidance, and recommendations to help all members of the Army family become more effective communicators and representatives of the Army -- creating an environment where trusted information is disseminated to the public in a timely manner.\n\nThe site also includes information referencing security tips, ways to report [scams](https://www.army.mil/socialmedia/scams/?from=st), and techniques criminals use on social media.\n\nIn addition, the Army recently published an [All Army Activities message](https://www.army.mil/e2/downloads/rv7/socialmedia/alaract_014_2017_professionalization_of_online_conduct.pdf) (ALARACT) that gives guidance on social media conduct. The ALARACT emphasizes that online behavior is viewed and held to the same standards as personal behavior.  Soldiers and their Families represent the Army, online and offline, and are personally responsible for all content they publish on social networking sites, blogs, and other websites.\n \n**What continued efforts are planned for the future?**\n\nThe Army will continue to explore and evaluate new innovative digital platforms for telling the Army story. \n\nOCPA's Digital Media Division will provide the Army relevant information and guidance to plan and execute an effective social media plan that aligns with the Department of the Army's larger communication strategy. \n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nSocial media is a powerful tool for Army organizations to genuinely connect first-hand with their online community.  The Army encourages the proper and effective use of social media to communicate, engage, and enable audiences to share the Army story.\n \n**Resources:**\n\n*  [Army Social Media](https://www.army.mil/socialmedia?from=st3)\n*  [Army Public Affairs](https://www.army.mil/info/institution/publicAffairs?from=st2)\n*  [Army Social Media Directory](https://www.army.mil/socialmedia/directory/?from=st)\n*  [Army Criminal Investigation Command](http://www.cid.army.mil/)\n*  Army.mil: [Ready and Resilient](https://www.army.mil/readyandresilient)\n\n**Related documents:** \n\n*   [ALARACT](https://www.army.mil/e2/downloads/rv7/socialmedia/alaract_014_2017_professionalization_of_online_conduct.pdf)\n*   [DOD Instruction Number 8550.01, \"DOD Internet Services and Internet-Based Capabilities.\" ](http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/855001p.pdf)\n*   [Army Criminal Investigation Command - Social Networking Safety Tips]( http://www.cid.army.mil/assets/docs/2can/SocialNetworkingSafetyTips.pdf)\n*   [AR 600-20 -- Army Command Policy]( http://www.apd.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/pdf/web/r600_20.pdf)\n\n**Related STAND-TO!**:\n\n*   [Online Conduct - Think, Type, Post](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-06-16)\n\n**Army on social media:** \n\n*   [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/USArmy) \n*   [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/USArmy) \n*   [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/usarmy) \n*   [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/soldiersmediacenter/)\n*   [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/usarmy/)\n\n\n",
