This reassures NATO allies and partners of America's dedication to enduring peace and stability in the region following Russia's intervention in Ukraine.\n\nOperation Atlantic Resolve began as [Persistent Presence](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-05-07) and centered on Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. In 2017, the exercises expanded to Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary and improved interoperability, built trust, and stabilized the region. \n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nUSAREUR continues Land Forces Assurance Exercises and continues persistent presence rotations. Through 2016, U.S.-based units deployed for three to nine months followed by European-based units (2nd Cavalry Regiment and 173rd Airborne Brigade). Since January 2017, brigade-size units rotate for nine month \"heel-to-toe\" deployments.\n\nThe 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, arrived January. The 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division, assumes the mission in September.\n\nThe 10th Combat Aviation Brigade arrived February. The follow-on unit has not yet been announced.\n\n**What continued efforts are planned for the future?**\n\nThrough rotational deployments and exercises, U.S. Army forces will continue to maintain a persistent presence in Poland and the Baltic. These training events are in addition to previously scheduled multinational land force military exercises in the region such as [Combined Resolve](http://www.eur.army.mil/7ATC/CombinedResolve.html) in Germany, [Saber Strike](http://www.eur.army.mil/SaberStrike/) in the Baltic region, [Rapid Trident](http://www.eur.army.mil/RapidTrident/) in Ukraine, and [Saber Guardian]( http://www.eur.army.mil/SaberGuardian/) in Bulgaria.\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nOperation Atlantic Resolve demonstrates U.S. commitment to NATO and U.S. collective defense responsibilities. This strategic partnership is built on 70 years of shared values, experiences, training, and commitment to a stable and prosperous Europe. A persistent presence and rotational training in Europe reassure the allies and builds the Army's joint, multinational, multiservice and interagency abilities. \n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [Atlantic Resolve](http://www.eur.army.mil/AtlanticResolve/)\n* [U.S. Army Europe's Major Exercises](http://www.eur.army.mil/exercises)\n* [U.S. Army Europe](http://www.eur.army.mil) \n* [3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry)  Division](http://carson.army.mil/4id/unit-pages/3abct.html)\n* [10th Combat Aviation Brigade](http://www.drum.army.mil/10thAB/Pages/10thAviationBrigadehome.aspx)\n* [U.S. European Command](http://www.eucom.mil/) \n\n**Related documents:** \n\n* [Atlantic Resolve]( http://www.eur.army.mil/organization/factsheets/Factsheet_AtlanticResolve.pdf)\n* [U.S. Army Europe's Contingency Response Force](http://www.eur.army.mil/pdf/USAREUR_AboutUs.pdf) \n\n**Related video:**\n\n* [Operation Atlantic Resolve -- Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLmQ9AUhWLm92jI0W_ZxCR9FrGzRe4M3ok&v=_T0IFGcYQsA)\n\n**Related articles:**\n\n* [Saber Guardian 17 kicks off with opening ceremony](https://www.army.mil/article/190627/)\n* [Mattis salutes NATO collective security](https://www.army.mil/article/190174/)\n* [Common Declaration of the Defence Ministers of the Enhanced Forward Presence  Host and Framework Nations on the Implementation of eFP](https://nato.usmission.gov/june-29-2017-efp-common-declaration/)  \n* [Seven nations, four branches, one mission](https://www.army.mil/article/189927/)  \n\n**USAREUR on social media:**\n\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/usarmyeurope)\n* [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/usarmyeurope)\n* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/usarmyeurope)\n* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/usarmyeurope)\n* [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/usarmyeurope_images)\n",
