The Army cannot achieve or maintain operational advantage unless it outpaces potential adversaries' development by building the future force. \n\nUnderstanding and addressing these issues requires examining today's operating environment through the lens of the Army's four strategic modernization aspirations: strategic, innovative, agile, and credible.\n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nAs investments in readiness continue to return greater dividends, the Army will expand investment in modernization for greater future lethality and build the future force through the entire doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, facilities (DOTMLPF) spectrum. \n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nThe Army will adapt its modernization efforts through four deliberate aspirations:\n\n* Strategic -- Manage modernization initiatives to account for uncertainty of both threats and opportunities through:\n  \n  * Shared Vision - define and implement a unified strategic vision that every stakeholder understands and follows\n  \n  * Prioritization -- rank the Army's full set of innovation initiatives to align with near-, mid-, and long-term strategic advantage\n\n* Innovative - Deliver novel and incremental capabilities through:\n  \n  * Top Talent - recruit, train, and deploy the right people to align skills and capabilities\n  \n  * Partnerships - harness the full value of external force-multipliers\n  \n  * Innovation Delivery - instill a culture of experimentation and define processes to manage the full spectrum of innovation\n\n* Agile -- Develop clear mechanisms while staying nimble:\n\n  * Speed of Execution - empower leaders to make metrics-based decisions\n\n  * Scale - address full scope of Army modernization\n\n  * Surge Capacity -- re-allocate resources to support changing priorities\n\n  * Linkages -- enable sharing and coordination\n\n  * Continuous Improvement -- self assess and adjust rapidly and constantly\n\n* Credible - Build strong relationships through efficiency and transparency:\n\n  * Engagement -- Provide transparency to Congressional leaders and collaborate with industry and academic partners\n\n  * Lean -- pare down processes to minimize duplication of efforts and make efficient use of resources\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nArmy forces must possess the capabilities --and be prepared to fight across multiple domains and through contested areas --to deter potential adversaries. And, should deterrence fail, rapidly defeat them. \n\nToday's operational environment is complex, uncertain, and dynamic, and requires innovative solutions. Political developments and diverse threats to the national security complicate the world in which the Army operates. Predicting battles is difficult as conflicts spread quickly across borders and involve increasing numbers of actors. Technological advances in the speed of innovation and magnitude of change are transforming every aspect of society, and warfare is no different. The Army is prepared to meet these challenges by proactively building and shaping the future force.\n \n**Related documents:**\n\n* [TRADOC Regulation 71-20, Concept Development, Capabilities Determination, and Capabilities Integration](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/tpubs/regs/tr71-20.pdf)\n\n**Related STAND-TO!:** \n\n* [Readiness](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2017-10-04)\n  \n\n\n",
