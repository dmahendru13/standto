This portal gives women and healthcare providers access to health-related resources and support that facilitate health and readiness in both the deployed and garrison settings.  \n\nWomen's health plays a vital role in the overall readiness of the Army and is supported by three of Army Medicine's four lines of effort -- \n\n* Readiness and Health\n* Healthcare Delivery\n* Force Development\n* Taking Care of Ourselves, Soldiers for Life, Department of the Army Civilians and Families\n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nThe women's health portal allows women to take proactive measures to positively influence their health by optimizing sleep, activity and nutrition within their unique lifestyle. \n\nThe women's health portal has been designed to help meet the unique needs by providing female service members, leaders and family members with up-to-date information about a variety of women's health topics to include: \n\n*  [Breastfeeding](https://phc.amedd.army.mil/topics/healthyliving/wh/Pages/BreastfeedingandBreastHealth.aspx)\n* [Deployment Health](https://phc.amedd.army.mil/TOPICS/HEALTHYLIVING/WH/Pages/Women'sHealthPortal.aspx) \n* [Health and Wellness](https://phc.amedd.army.mil/topics/healthyliving/wh/Pages/Women'sHealthPortal-HealthandWellness.aspx) \n* [Mental Health and Substance Abuse](https://phc.amedd.army.mil/topics/healthyliving/wh/Pages/Women'sHealthPortal-MentalHealth.aspx) \n* [Pregnancy](https://phc.amedd.army.mil/topics/healthyliving/wh/Pages/Women'sHealthPortal-Pregnancy.aspx) \n* [Sexual Health](https://phc.amedd.army.mil/topics/healthyliving/wh/Pages/Women.aspx)\n* [Violence Prevention](https://phc.amedd.army.mil/topics/healthyliving/wh/Pages/HealthyRelationships.aspx)\n* [Women's Health Emerging Issues](https://phc.amedd.army.mil/topics/healthyliving/wh/Pages/Women'sHealthPortal-HotTopics.aspx) \n* [Self-Care Charts](https://phc.amedd.army.mil/topics/healthyliving/wh/Pages/Women'sHealthPortal-SelfCare.aspx)\n\n**What continued efforts are planned for the future?**\n\nThe Army Public Health Center and Army Medicine are continually seeking ways to raise awareness, educate, and empower women to make their health a top priority and to encourage them to take steps to improve their physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health.\n   \n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nSince the days of the American Revolutionary War, women have served a vital role in the U.S. fighting forces and they continue to be a significant source of strength for the nation. Currently, women make up nearly 15 percent of the active duty Army and can now serve in all Army occupations.  \n\nAs women expand into different roles in the military ranks, the Army realizes the importance of an increased need for health-related resources and support specifically tailored to meet the needs of female service members. \n\nThe Army is committed to meeting the health needs of women so that they are effectively integrated and continue to be effective members of the team. \n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [Women's Health Portal](https://phc.amedd.army.mil/topics/healthyliving/wh/Pages/default.aspx)\n* [U.S. Army Public Health Center](https://phc.amedd.army.mil/Pages/default.aspx)\n* [Performance Triad](http://armymedicine.mil/Pages/performance-triad.aspx)\n\n\n**Related STAND-TO!:**\n\n* [The Performance Triad](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-08-12)",
