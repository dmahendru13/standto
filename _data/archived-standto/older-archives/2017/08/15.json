Major elements of the WCTP include:\n\n* [Warrior Transition Units](http://wct.army.mil/modules/soldier/s1-wtu.html) (WTUs) and [Community Care Units](http://www.wct.army.mil/documents/factsheets/CCU_Factsheet.pdf) (CCUs) \n* [U.S. Army Wounded Warrior Program (AW2)](http://wct.army.mil/modules/veterans/v2-aw2EligibilityEnrollment.html)\n* [Comprehensive Transition Plan](http://wct.army.mil/modules/soldier/s1-ctp.html) (CTP) \n* [Triad of Care](http://wct.army.mil/modules/cadre/c1-rolesResponsibilities.html#TRIAD)\n* [Interdisciplinary Team](http://wct.army.mil/modules/cadre/c1-rolesResponsibilities.html)\n* [Career and Education](http://wct.army.mil/modules/soldier/s4-careerPlanning.html) \n* [Health and Recovery](http://wct.army.mil/modules/soldier/s5-adaptiveReconditioning.html)\n* Understanding [Integrated Disability Evaluation System](http://wct.army.mil/modules/soldier/s6-ides.html) (IDES)\n* Access to [Soldier and Family Assistance Centers](https://go.usa.gov/xRdrr) and other resources\n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nThe WCT's mission is to oversee, integrate, and synchronize policy, advocacy, and execution for warrior care initiatives and the Army Wounded Warrior Program as an integral enabler of Army Readiness. \n\nSince 2007, the following competencies are essential to the Army Warrior Care and Transition mission:  \n\n* Act as the overall proponent for the [Army's Warrior Care and Transition Program](http://wct.army.mil/modules/soldier/s1-wctpProgram.html).\n* Evaluate and standardize Warrior Transition Battalion (WTB) policies and procedures.\n* Support wounded, ill and injured Soldiers throughout their [Comprehensive Transition Plan](http://www.wct.army.mil/modules/soldier/s1-ctp.html)(CTP).\n* Assist wounded, ill, and injured Soldiers and Veterans with career and education opportunities.\n* Ensure execution of warrior care programs, including the [U.S. Army Wounded Warrior Program](http://wct.army.mil/modules/veterans/v2-aw2EligibilityEnrollment.html) (AW2), for the MEDCOM commander. \n* Coordinate with the U.S. Department of Army staff, Congress, and other services and departments on warrior care matters.\n\nCurrently, the Army's WCTP consists of 14 WTBs on Army installations throughout the United States. In addition, 12 installations have CCUs, allowing Soldiers with non-complex medical cases to heal in their home communities with the support of their Families and caregivers.\n\n**What continued efforts are planned for the future?**\n\nThe Army recognizes warrior care as an enduring mission. As Army WCT moves forward, it will continue evolving to meet the changing needs of its population as well as the Army. \n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nWCT works to ensure everything possible is done to enable Soldiers to return to duty. WCT also plays an important role in ensuring Reserve Component Soldiers receive the care they require prior to and after deployment to remain mission ready.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [Army Warrior Care & Transition](http://wct.army.mil/)\n* [WCT Speaks, the official newsletter of Army WCT](http://wct.army.mil/newsletters/wct_speaks/wct_speaks_June2017.html)\n* [Did You Know: WCT Fact Sheets](http://wct.army.mil/documents/brochures.html#DYK)\n\n**Related documents:**\n\n* [Warrior Care and Transition](http://wct.army.mil/documents/factsheets/WCT_Overview_FactSheet.pdf)\n* [WTU Fact Sheet](http://wct.army.mil/documents/factsheets/WTU_Fact_Sheet.pdf)\n* [CCU Fact Sheet](http://wct.army.mil/documents/factsheets/CCU_Factsheet.pdf)\n\n**Army WCT on social media:**\n\n* [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/armywarriorcare/albums)\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ArmyWCT)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/armyWCT)\n\n",
