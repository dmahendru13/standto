The exercise uses joint, combined and interagency operations to achieve holistic and integrated responses to transnational threats.\n\n[U.S. Army South](http://www.arsouth.army.mil/), along with representatives from 25 nations, will take part in the PANAMAX 2017 exercise.  This year's exercise brings together sea, air and land forces in a joint and combined operation focused on defending the Panama Canal from attacks as well as responding to natural disasters and pandemic outbreaks in various locations. \n\nIn addition to the United States, more than 80 participants from Argentina, Belize, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, France,  Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Netherlands, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, United Kingdom, and United States. Also, representatives from Germany and Portugal will be joining the exercise as observers.\n\nThis year the exercise will be conducted from August 12 to 16 with forces in multiple locations: Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas;  Mayport, Florida; Davis-Monthan, Arizona; Homestead Air Force Reserve Base, Florida.\n\n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nThis major multinational exercise has grown dramatically since 2003 when the U.S. Army conducted the first exercise together with Panama and Chile.\n\nParticipants are able to exchange their experiences, expertise and gain new knowledge about each other's culture and people. These interactions strengthen the U.S. Army bonds across the region and foster long-lasting friendships and understanding among its partner nations, ultimately benefiting the security of the region.\n \n  \n**What continued efforts are planned for the future?**\n\nArmy South conducts numerous exercises and operations, such as PANAMAX, which provide high-level training opportunities for the service members and partner nations. Future exercises will build upon this training to ensure we are prepared to deploy and conduct contingency operations together.\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nPANAMAX provides opportunities for the participating nations, along with Army South to join efforts to consider threats from transregional criminal organizations, while providing for humanitarian relief and security of the Panama Canal.\n\nAll the participants in PANAMAX benefit their countries and the region by increasing professional understanding of the Western Hemisphere and reassuring the nation's commitment to regional peace and respect for sovereignty.\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [U.S. Army South](http://www.arsouth.army.mil/) \n* [U.S. Army Southern Command website](http://www.southcom.mil/)\nArmy.mil: * [Central/South America and Caribbean News]( http://www.army.mil/news/centralsouthcaribbean/) \n\n**Related STAND-TO!:**\n\n* [U.S. Army South Command Strategy](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-02-06/) \n* [Globally Engaged Army](https://www.army.mil/standto/2016-06-20) \n* [Army Readiness Guidance](https://www.army.mil/standto/2016-05-19) \n\n**Army South on social media:**\n\n* [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/usarmysouth) \n* [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/ArmySouth)\n* [Twitter (@ARSOUTH)](https://twitter.com/armysouth) \n\n",
