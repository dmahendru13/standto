    "body": "#######Provided by Mission Command Center of Excellence, Combined Arms Center\n\n**What is it?**\n\nField Manual (FM) 6-22 *Leader Development* provides a doctrinal framework covering methods for leaders to develop other leaders, improve their organizations, build teams, and develop themselves. The principal audience for FM 6-22 is all leaders, military and civilian, with an application focus at the operational and tactical levels. \n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\n[Center for Army Leadership](http://usacac.army.mil) (CAL), a part of the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command's Mission Command Center of Excellence, has developed FM 6-22 *Leader Development* into an enhanced electronic book (e2Book). \n\nThis new e2Book is an interactive digital publication which represents a \"living doctrine\" supplement to FM 6-22. It contains interactive content, figures and tables not included in the printed edition of FM 6-22. This medium uses multimedia, such as videos, pictures and interactive diagrams to enhance the learning leader development concepts. It also provides embedded links to other doctrinal publications and resources relevant to FM 6-22. The e2Book can be downloaded to computers, tablets and smart phones.   \n\nThe FM 6-22 e2Book is available on the [Central Army Registry](https://rdl.train.army.mil/catalog-ws/view/FM6-22Supplement). This doctrine supplement is reaching audiences across the Army in a way that makes leader development more accessible and understandable. \n\nInteractive diagrams, such as the Leader Competency Model, clearly communicate a concept vital to Army leadership and leader development. Video interviews illustrate to Army leaders the importance of leader development concepts in ways users can relate. The e2Book is also organized with modified tables that make information accessible for quick reference.  \n        \nWith the update to the FM 6-22 *Leader Development* the Army is able to make the concepts more easily accessible for Army leaders. This will aid Army leaders to create leader development programs, assess leader performance indicators, and conduct developmental counseling.  \n \n**What continued efforts are planned for the future?**\n\nCAL will continue to champion leader development through the refinement and development of: \n\n* FM 6-22 *Leader Development* \n* LeaderMap app\n* FM 6-22 *Leader Development* E2 publication\n* Virtual Improvement Center leader development lessons\n* Army Leadership Development Strategy\n* Army Profession and Leader Development Forum  \n\nThese and other projects arm leaders with the tools and concepts necessary to influence people by providing purpose, direction and motivation to accomplish the mission and improve the organization.   \n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nLeader development is fundamental to the success of the United States Army. It helps to grow Soldiers and Army Civilians into competent and confident leaders capable of decisive action. \n\nFM 6-22 *Leader Development*  provides comprehensive guidelines in facilitating readiness, the Army leader's most important objective. \n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/) \n* [U.S. Army Combined Arms Center](http://usacac.army.mil)\n* [Mission Command Center of Excellence](http://usacac.army.mil/organizations/mccoe)\n* [The Center for Army Leadership](http://usacac.army.mil/organizations/mccoe/cal)\n\n**Related documents:**\n\n* [FM 6-22 *E2 Publication*](https://rdl.train.army.mil/catalog-ws/view/FM6-22Supplement)\n* [FM 6-22 *Leader Development*](http://www.apd.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/pdf/web/fm6_22.pdf)\n* [Leader Map](https://rdl.train.army.mil/catalog-ws/view/100.ATSC/512386F1-0282-42C4-94B6-F6A65727FBC0-1435170299189/index.html)\n\n**Related STAND-TO!:**\n\n* [Army Reserve Leadership Development](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2017-05-30)    \n* [Commander 360 Program](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2016-03-15/)   \n* [Army Leader Development Program](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-04-15/)  \n* [FORSCOM Leader Development Toolbox](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-03-12/) \n* [Army Leader Development Strategy 2013](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-06-19/)\n",

There's really nothing that we do that is more important in the Army than developing leaders by giving them the tools to develop other leaders.\n\n\\- Gen. David G.
