This is a multicomponent-sourced organization of more than 8,000 active- and reserve component Soldiers and Department of the Army Civilians. First Army provides training support to reserve-component units of all types, ranging in size from division headquarters to two-person [Unit Ministry Teams](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2016-02-17). \n \n\n**What has the Army done / is doing?**\n\n[First Army](http://www.first.army.mil/) was established in France on August 10, 1918, under the leadership of Gen. John J. Pershing and served as the expeditionary force headquarters leading American troops during World War I. Troops under First Army's command routed the Germans during the Battle of St. Mihiel, breaking through the Hindenburg line, and speeding the German surrender near Verdun in the Meuse-Argonne offensive.\n\nDuring World War II, First Army commanded the D-Day operation and established an impressive field of \"firsts:\" first on the beaches of Normandy, first into Paris, first to break the Siegfried Line.\n \nCurrently, First Army, a three-star headquarters at Rock Island Arsenal, Illinois,  has the critical role of partnering with all Army National Guard and Army Reserve units in the continental United States and two U.S. territories. The unit provides advice, assistance and training support to ensure the Army's reserve component meets the Chief of Staff of the Army's No. 1 priority: Readiness. Since 9/11, First Army has mobilized, trained and deployed more than 1.3 million Soldiers, joint service teammates and civilian interagency personnel. \n  \n \n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned?**\n\nThe Army of the 21st century requires agile and flexible forces that are integrated to leverage and sustain the unique capabilities of all components, active and reserve, in training and combat. \n\nTo maintain Army Total Force readiness, First Army is committed to assisting Army National Guard and Army Reserve commanders achieve readiness and enable U.S. Army Forces Command to provide combatant commanders with ready forces in support of worldwide requirements. \n\n  \n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\n \nFirst Army is U.S. Forces Command's coordinating authority for Army Total Force Policy. This directive requires the collaboration of active- and reserve-component forces during pre-deployment training. It directs the Army to  organize, man, train and equip the active and reserve components as an integrated force. \n\nWith more than 60 percent of the Army's combat support residing in the reserve component, the Army Reserve and Army National Guard are vital to accomplishing the multifaceted global mission.\n\n   \n**Resources:**\n\n* [First Army](http://www.first.army.mil/)\n* [First Army Division East](www.first.army.mil/diveast/)\n* [First Army Division West](www.first.army.mil/divwest)\n* [Army.mil: First Army](https://www.army.mil/firstarmy)\n\nRelated STAND-TO!:\n\n* [Army Total Force Policy](https://www.army.mil/standto/2010-07-27)* [Army Total Force Policy- Reserve Component Training Integration](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-05-21)\n* [Reserve Component Mobilization Operations           ](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-03-25)\n\n** First Army on social media:**\n\n* [First Army Division East](https://www.facebook.com/FirstArmy/)\n\n\n",
