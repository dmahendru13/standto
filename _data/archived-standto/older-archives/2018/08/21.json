    "body": "#######Provided by Headquarter of the Army, Deputy Chief of Staff, G-1\n\n**What is it?**\n\nThe U.S. Army defines online conduct as the use of electronic communications in an official or personal capacity that is consistent with [Army Values](https://www.army.mil/standto/2018-06-12) and standards of conduct.\n\nOnline misconduct is a term that describes unacceptable or improper behavior through the use of technology. Examples include, but are not limited to:  harassment, bullying, hazing, stalking, discrimination, retaliation, or any other types of misconduct that undermines dignity and respect.\n\nElectronic communications is considered the transfer of information (signs, texts, images, sounds, or data) transmitted by computer, phone or other electronic device. Electronic communications include, but are not limited to: text messages, emails, chats, instant messaging, screensavers, blogs, social media sites, electronic device applications, and web/video conferencing.\n\n**What has the Army done/is doing?**\n\nIn 2015, the Army initiated a campaign, *Think, Type and Post,* to educate and inform the Army Family on the proper use of electronic communications. \n\nIn July 2018, the [Deputy Chief of Staff, Army G-1](http://www.armyg1.army.mil/) released an All Army Activities (ALARACT) message on the [Professionalization of Online Conduct](https://www.army.mil/e2/downloads/rv7/socialmedia/ALARACT_058_2018_PROFESSIONALIZATION_OF_ONLINE_CONDUCT.pdf). The [Army Values](https://www.army.mil/standto/2018-06-12), requires that everyone be treated with dignity and respect, and is a critical component of the Army Profession. \n\nThe [Army Values](http://www.army.mil/values/?st) also apply to the online conduct. Individuals' interactions in-person and online reflect on the Army and its values. Any type of online misconduct undermines dignity and respect and is not consistent with Army Values.  Commanders and leaders reinforce a climate where members of the Army team understand that online misconduct is inconsistent with Army Values. \n\nSoldiers and DA Civilians who participate in or condone misconduct, whether in person or online, may be subject to criminal disciplinary, and/or other corrective action.  Misconduct of contractor employees is referred to their contracting agency through applicable channels for appropriate action.\n\n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned?**\n\nThe Army will continue to ensure that Soldiers, civilians and contractors understand and apply the *Think, Type, Post* rule  when engaging in electronic communication:\n \n* **Think** about the message being communicated and who could potentially view it.\n* **Type** about a communication that is consistent with [Army Values](https://www.army.mil/standto/2018-06-12).\n* **Post** only those messages that demonstrate dignity and respect for self and others. \n\nArmy will continue to reinforce the prevention, reporting and addressing of online-related incidents.\n\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nThe Army is a values-based organization and any online misconduct negatively impacts command climate and readiness. Readiness depends on Soldiers living the [Army Ethic](https://www.army.mil/standto/2018-07-12) and Values, to make them trusted professionals of character, competence and commitment.  \n \n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [U.S. Army Social Media Guidelines](https://www.army.mil/socialmedia/soldiers)\n* [Army Values](http://www.army.mil/values/)\n\n**Related documents:**\n\n* [AR 600-20: Army Command Policy](http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r600_20.pdf)\n* [AR 600-100: Army Leadership](http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r600_100.pdf)\n* [AR 25-13: Army Telecommunications and Unified Capabilities]( https://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/pdf/web/ARN3184_AR25-13_Final_for_web.pdf)\n* [ALARACT 058/2018: Professionalization of Online Conduct](https://www.army.mil/e2/downloads/rv7/socialmedia/ALARACT_058_2018_PROFESSIONALIZATION_OF_ONLINE_CONDUCT.pdf)\n   \n\n**Related STAND-TO!:**\n\n* [Army Value](https://www.army.mil/standto/2018-06-12)\n* [Army Ethics](https://www.army.mil/standto/2018-07-12)\n* [Army Social Media Resources](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2017-05-18)\n\n**Related articles:**\n\n* [Army Families: Are you doing your part on social media to keep Soldiers safe?](https://www.army.mil/article/209671?st)\n* [Safety, security key to social media use for Soldiers, Civilians, Families](https://www.army.mil/article/208411?st)\n\n**U.S. Army on social media:**\n\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/USarmy/)\n* [Twitter @USArmy](https://www.twitter.com/USarmy/)\n* [Instagram](http://instagram.com/usarmy/)\n* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/usarmy/)\n\n",
