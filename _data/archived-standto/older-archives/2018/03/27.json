Several Security Force Assistance Brigade Soldiers have been promoted to sergeant. \n \n \n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nThe Army plans to field six Security Force Assistance Brigades across the Total Army: five in the Regular Army and one in the Army National Guard. The Army has built the first Security Force Assistance Brigade at Fort Benning, Georgia, and is standing up the second Security Force Assistance Brigade at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.  \n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nThe strategic environment requires the Army to continue developing capability while generating ready forces to conduct decisive action across all domains. \n\nSecurity Force Assistance Brigades are designed to enhance Army readiness by reducing the demand for conventional Brigade Combat Teams for combat Advising over time.  This will reduce the demand for Brigade Combat Teams to conduct security force assistance operations, while allowing Brigade Combat Teams to focus on readiness for full-spectrum contingency operations. \n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [U.S. Army Forces Command](https://www.forscom.army.mil )\n* [Human Resources Command: SFAB](https://go.usa.gov/xnp8h )\n* [SFAB open opportunities](https://go.usa.gov/xnp8h) (*Contact career manager for available in numerous MOSs, especially in 12B, 13F, 25B/C/U, 35F, 68W, 89D, 91B, and 92Y*) \n\n**Related STAND-TO!:**\n\n* [Security Force Assistance Brigade](https://www.army.mil/standto/2017-02-17)\n\n**Related videos:**\n \n* [Security Force Assistance Brigade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btcDQnO7cCg)\n* [First SFAB Sergeants Promoted Under New Policy](https://www.dvidshub.net/video/563474/first-sfab-sergeants-promoted-under-new-policy)       \n* [35F Testimonial](https://www.dvidshub.net/video/566027/staff-sgt-justin-seeley)\n* [92Y Testimonial](https://www.dvidshub.net/video/566029/sgt-1st-class-candace-johnson)\n* [13F Testimonial](https://www.dvidshub.net/news/254240/fisters-armys-1st-sfab-encourage-13fs-volunteer )\n\n",
