Cadets present capstone projects reflecting senior theses, design projects, culminating performances, and extramural research projects effecting current world issues. These efforts reflect USMA's strong connections to the Army, the Department of Defense, and academia and beyond.\n\n \n**What has the Army done/ is doing?**\n\nWest Point provides cadets a broad liberal education that consists of fifty-percent math, science and engineering courses and fifty percent social sciences and humanities courses. In addition, cadets choose from more than 35 majors that provide a study-in-depth experience. In the majors, cadets provided the opportunity to conduct research to explore real-world challenges and opportunities through partnering with other institutions of higher learning, military commands and major research laboratories. \n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nWest Point continues to be a top tier academic institution committed to providing the resources necessary to deliver a world-class education. USMA is dedicated to bringing together the country's best and brightest students and faculty members devoted to rigorous scholarship and cadet-focused learning.  \n\nUSMA's overarching goal is for future leaders to integrate knowledge and skills from a variety of disciplines to anticipate and respond appropriately to opportunities and challenges in a changing world. These skills include:  \n\n* Communicate effectively with all audiences\n* Think innovatively and accept risk to pursue solutions\n* Apply ethical reasoning \n* Integrate humanities and science in decision-making \n* Synthesize knowledge and concepts \n\n\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nThe Army requires leaders who can innovate and adapt concepts, equipment, and training to be ready for the next war. The Army must grow its operational force by reshaping it to be more robust and successful in all domains along with modernizing it with the best weapons and equipment available. Institutional efforts such as USMA's provide the Army with the intellectual capital to drive these efforts.\n\nProjects Day inspires cadets to achieve academic excellence in their chosen profession by developing intellectual leaders who can navigate a diverse and dynamic world. USMA supports the Army's responsibility to deliver intellectual leaders who are ready, trained and equipped to meet the operational demands of combat and to strengthen the defense of the nation. \n\n    \n**Resources:**\n\n* [The U.S. Military Academy at West Point](https://www.usma.edu/SitePages/Home.aspx)\n* [West Point Admissions](https://www.usma.edu/admissions/SitePages/Home.aspx)\n* [West Point Academics](https://www.usma.edu/dean/SitePages/Home.aspx)\n\n\n**Related STAND-TO!:**\n\n* [West Point Leader Development System](https://www.army.mil/standto/2018-03-13) \n* [West Point's Character Development Strategy](https://www.army.mil/standto/2018-01-08)\n* [U.S. Military Academy at West Point](https://www.army.mil/standto/2017-11-21)\n\n \n\n \n\n",
