    "body": "#######Provided by Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-4\n\n**What is it?**\n\nThe Army Readiness-Common Operating Picture (AR-COP) is a web-based, information and mission command enabling sustainment tool.  AR-COP was formerly known as the Materiel - Common Operating Picture (M-COP) and was developed and sustained by Army Materiel Command's [Logistics Support Activity](https://www.logsa.army.mil/) (LOGSA). \n\nThe AR-COP establishes a decision analytics and business intelligence foundation for the predictive analytics and decision support capabilities for the future.  AR-COP provides commanders at every echelon, both at home station and deployed, a tailorable, integrated readiness common operating picture for use across the full spectrum of operations.   \n\n\n**What has the Army done / is doing?**\n\nThe AR-COP taps into the powerful business intelligence capabilities resident within the Army Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems such as [Global Combat Service Support -- Army]( https://gcss.army.mil), [Logistics Modernization Program](https://www.army.mil/LMP), and [General Fund Enterprise Business System](http://www.eis.army.mil/programs/gfebs). It integrates and visualizes relevant readiness information into a single source dashboard with near real-time combat power and logistics statuses that can be continually up-dated. The initial operating capability was developed and implemented in June 2018. \n \n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nThe AR-COP is set to release additional functional improvements every 60-90 days starting with the first scheduled release in August 2018. The AR-COP will continue to leverage capabilities resident within the evolving ERP Family of Systems and the AR-COP capability will move towards providing actionable near real-time information.\n \n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nThe AR-COP delivers commanders a data-driven analytical decision making capability at all levels of the Army. It will increase lethality and readiness with a fully integrated dashboard for all of the warfighting functions through the Army's emerging [Mission Command Common Operating Environment](https://www.army.mil/article/195864/)(MC COE).  \n \n \n**Resources:**\n\n* [GCSS- Army](https://gcss.army.mil/)\n* [HQDA G-4](https://www.army.mil/info/organization/unitsandcommands/dcs/g-4#org-about) \n\n**Related document:**\n\n* AKO: [AR-COP Brochure](https://www.ako1.us.army.mil/suite/files/50458706) *CAC log-in required*\n\n\n**Related STAND-TO!:**\n\n* [Global Combat Support System](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2017-06-06)\n* [Materiel Common Operating Picture](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-02-11/)\n* [Logistics Support Activity](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2017-05-31)\n\n\n**Related articles :**\n\n* [Army Sustainment November-December 2017](https://issuu.com/fredbaker/docs/novdec2017)\n* [Army forges ahead with Common Operating Environment for mission command](https://www.army.mil/article/195864/) \n\n",
