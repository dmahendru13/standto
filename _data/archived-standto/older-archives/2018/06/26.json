Conner will be posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest award of valor, at a White House Ceremony at 3:30 p.m. EST. Conner is receiving this award  for his combat actions near Houssen, France, on Jan.  24, 1945, during the World War II.\n  \nConner served as an intelligence officer with the 3rd Infantry Division during this time. He volunteered to maneuver 400 yards through intense enemy concentrations, calling in friendly artillery fire on the advancing enemy forces.\n\nConner remained in a compromised position for three hours during the repeated enemy onslaught. As the enemy began to mass in an overwhelming assault, Conner ordered friendly artillery directly on his own position, until the attack was shattered. The artillery he directed killed approximately 50 German soldiers and wounded an estimated 100 more. \n\nThe Medal of Honor award will be presented to Conner's widow, Pauline Conner. \n\n**What has the Army done / is doing?**\n\n1st Lt. Garlin M. Conner will become the 56th Medal of Honor Recipient from 3rd ID, and the 40th 3rd ID Soldier to receive the Medal of Honor for actions during World War II.\n \nThe [Office of the Chief of Public Affairs](https://www.army.mil/info/institution/publicAffairs/) has created a [Medal of Honor]( http://www.army.mil/medalofhonor/?fom=st) microsite to pay tribute to the recipients, including Conner.

Both the ceremonies will be live-streamed from his [Medal of Honor website](https://go.usa.gov/xQT9v).\n \n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nThe Army's greatest assets are the people- the finest men and women the nation has to offer.
