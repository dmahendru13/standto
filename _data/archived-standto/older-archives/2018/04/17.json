U.S. Army Africa leverages the Total Army and uses a regional focus, embedded in the Army's global engagement strategy to strengthen African land forces and regional organizations. These foundational capabilities help synchronize efforts and provide options to prevent conflict, to shape the security environment and to win conflicts. U.S. Army Africa is committed to strengthening relationships with partner nations in Africa. \n\n U.S. Army Africa will continue to develop and build upon the established relationships and partnerships.\n \n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nThe Army is optimizing interoperability with the nation's allies and partners to strengthen alliances, attract new partners and deliver more effective coalition operations.\n\nThe African continent is a complex environment with over one billion people and more than 2,000 spoken languages in a continent three times the size of the U.S. The importance of building partnerships across Africa is more relevant than ever in light of the growth of regional and transnational violent extremist organizations (VEOs). \n\nAfrican Land Forces Summit brings together the community of land forces in Africa, and represents a unified approach to confronting regional and continental challenges such as VEOs and illicit trafficking.\n\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n\n* [U.S. Army Africa](http://www.usaraf.army.mil/)\n* [U.S. Africa Command](http://www.africom.mil/)\n \n**Related STAND-TO!:**\n\n* [U.S. Army Africa](https://www.army.mil/standto/2018-02-05)\n\n**Related articles:**\n\n* [African Land Forces Summit 2018 initial planning event](https://www.army.mil/article/198034)\n* [African Land Forces Summit 2018 ](https://www.dvidshub.net/feature/ALFS18)\n* [African Land Forces Summit 2017](https://www.dvidshub.net/news/233617/malawi-concludes-successful-african-land-forces-summit)\n \n\n**U.S. Army Africa's social media presence:**\n\n* [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/ArmyAfrica)\n* [Twitter: @USArmyAfrica](https://twitter.com/USArmyAfrica)\n\n",
