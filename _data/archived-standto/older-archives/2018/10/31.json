The goal of this initiative is to accelerate the delivery of AI enabled capabilities. USASOC will look at how AI and machine learning capabilities can empower its Soldiers for integrated operations in the physical, virtual, and cognitive realms. \n\nUSASOC's interest is motivated by the new [ARSOF Vision](https://go.usa.gov/xPyYw) to \"relentlessly pursue competitive advantages.\" It is also informed by collaborative work with the U.S. Army's [Unified Quest (UQ) Artificial Intelligence](http://www.arcic.army.mil/Initiatives/UnifiedQuest) line of effort, the [Mad Scientists Initiative](https://www.army.mil/standto/2018-01-30) and the [ARSOF Operating Concept](http://www.soc.mil/USASOCTalks/ARSOFConcept.html).\n \n\n**What has the Army done/is doing?**\n\nThe Army is determining how to operationalize AI in support of [Multi-Domain Operations]( https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2018-10-04/?) (MDO) and to enable its Soldiers through its [Unified Quest 2019](http://www.arcic.army.mil/Initiatives/UnifiedQuest) Artificial Intelligence line of effort. To reinforce the Army's exploration, USASOC's G9 directorate will host an AI workshop on Oct. 30-31, 2018 at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. \n\nAI initiatives like UQ19 and USASOC's workshop supports the [National Defense Strategy]( https://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/2018-National-Defense-Strategy-Summary.pdf) and the [Army's six modernization priorities]( https://www.army.mil/standto/2018-01-16) by pursuing advances in \"computing, 'big data' analytics, artificial intelligence, autonomy, robotics, directed energy, hypersonics, and biotechnology.\"   \n\nThe required capabilities from the ARSOF Operating Concept  an *Empowered ARSOF Soldier, Integrated Unit, and Institutional Agility*  are aligned with the [Army Vision](https://www.army.mil/standto/2018-06-07) to \"win ... in a joint, multi-domain, high intensity conflict while simultaneously deterring others and maintaining its ability to conduct irregular warfare.\" \n \n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned?**\n\nThe Army's UQ19 effort will continue through May 2019 with a Deep Future Wargame and an Artificial Intelligence Seminar. USASOC's AI workshop will give both the Army and USASOC better insights into how they can accelerate development initiatives. USASOC is using its workshop to seek four key outcomes: \n\n* (1) Identify game changing technologies and/or leap-ahead material solutions.\n* (2) Foster innovation. \n* (3) Deliver actionable outcomes that align with science and technology investment areas.\n* (4) Continue to advance USASOC's upstream Force Modernization Campaign. \n \n \n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nIntegrating USASOC's AI initiatives with the Army's [Multi Domain Operations](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2018-10-04/?s_cid=standto) effort will ensure that the Army can  leverage adaptive and innovative institutions, empowered Soldiers, and integrated units capable of delivering unmatched special operations capabilities.  \n \n**Resources**:\n\n* [U.S. Army Special Operations Command](http://www.soc.mil/USASOCHQ/USASOCHQ.html)\n* [ARCIC Unified Quest AI Initiative](http://www.arcic.army.mil/Initiatives/UnifiedQuest)\n\n**Related documents**:\n\n* [Army Special Operations Forces VISION](https://go.usa.gov/xPyYw)\n* [ARSOF Operating Concept](http://www.soc.mil/USASOCTalks/ARSOFConcept.html)\n* [National Defense Strategy](https://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/2018-National-Defense-Strategy-Summary.pdf)\n\n\n**Related STAND-TO!:**\n\n* [Multi Domain Operations](https://www.army.mil/standto/2018-10-04/)\n* [U.S. Army Modernization Strategy](https://www.army.mil/standto/2018-06-06)\n* [The Army Vision](https://www.army.mil/standto/2018-06-07)\n* [USASOC 2035 Strategy and Campaign Plan](https://www.army.mil/standto/2017-08-10)\n\n\n**Related articles**:\n\n* [Artificial intelligence likely to help shape future battlefield, says Army vice chief](https://www.army.mil/article/210134)",
