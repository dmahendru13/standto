USARCENT has built the framework for integration of Cyberspace operations into USARCENT plans, operations and exercises across five primary lines of effort (LOE) which include the following:\n\n* LOE 1: Build the USARCENT Cyberspace Workforce.\n* LOE 2:  Conduct Cyberspace Operations.\n* LOE 3:  Identify and Develop Cyberspace Capabilities.\n* LOE 4:  Invest in Facilities, Systems and Infrastructure.\n* LOE 5:  Develop Partnerships.\n\nUSARCENT has focused on key activities to include cyberspace education of the USARCENT workforce. Instruction like the [Army Leader's Cyberspace Operations Course (ALCOC)](https://www.slideshare.net/afcea/the-importance-of-educating-the-force-on-cyberspace-operations-technet-augusta-2015) and [Executive Cyberspace Operations Seminar (ECOS)](https://go.usa.gov/xnwvX) have been successful tools for teaching doctrine and lessons learned for USARCENT Soldiers and senior leadership.   \n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nArmy leaders are developing and integrating Cyberspace, Electronic Warfare and Spectrum Management into the cyber branch. USARCENT supports Army and joint efforts and has contributed to the Cyberspace Electromagnetic Activities (CEMA) Section Force Design Update Operational and Organizational Concept and the Cyber Strategy for the Joint Force (Draft 2017).\n \n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n \nRapid growth in information and communications technology affects every aspect of the Army. Improvements in speed, connectivity, and access to the cyberspace domain bring both incredible opportunities and significant risks. Preventing conflict, shaping security environments, and winning wars while operating as part of a Joint Force with multiple partners requires a proficient cyberspace force operating effectively in and through cyberspace to meet service and joint requirements.\n\n**References:**\n\n* [U.S. Army Central](http://www.usarcent.army.mil/)\n\n* [Army.mil News: U.S. Army Central](https://www.army.mil/usarcent)\n\n**Related documents:**\n\n* [FM 3-12: Cyberspace and Electronic Warfare Operations](https://go.usa.gov/xnwv8) \n\n* [USARCENT Cyberspace Strategy (FY 17-18) for Unified Land Operations (2016)](http://www.usarcent.army.mil/Portals/1/FOIA/USARCENT-FY17-18-CyberspaceStrategyRelease.pdf?ver=2017-08-30-161305-340) \n\n\n* [Army Cyberspace Strategy for Unified Land Operations 2025 (March 2016)](http://www.arcic.army.mil/app_Documents/tradoc_ausa_force2025andbeyond-unifiedlandoperations-wininacomplexworld_07oct2014.pdf)\n\n**Related STAND-TO!:**\n\n* [U.S. Army Central](https://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2017-12-12)\n\n**Related articles:**\n\n* [Fighting in the cyber domain: US Army Central creates cyberspace strategy]( https://www.army.mil/article/180101/fighting_in_the_cyber_domain_us_army_central_creates_cyberspace_strategy)    (2018)\n\n* [Operators shift to cyber electromagnetic activities]( https://www.army.mil/article/165494/operators_shift_to_cyber_electromagnetic_activities)\n",
