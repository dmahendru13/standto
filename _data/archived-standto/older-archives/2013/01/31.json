    "body": "**What is it?**\n\nThe Army Surgeon General has championed the new Performance Triad of Activity, Nutrition and Sleep, to build resilience, improve readiness and enhance the health of the Army family.  \n\nDuring the last 20 years, there has been a dramatic increase in obesity among adults, children and adolescents in the U.S. According to the 2012 National Examination Survey (for 2009-2010,) approximately 41 million women, 37 million men, five million girls and seven million boys were obese. \n\nThe U.S. Army and the armed forces are not immune to this health crisis. Between 1998 and 2010, the number of active-duty overweight or obese military personnel more than tripled. Approximately nine million young adults in the prime recruitment ages of 17-24 are \"too fat to fight\" and serve as a member of our nation's fighting force.  Nationally, only about 25 percent of young adults are eligible to serve. The remaining adults are not eligible to enlist due to obesity or other preventable health conditions.  \n       \n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nAs the Army seeks to attract and retain quality Soldiers and civilians, it must also find ways to influence lifestyle behaviors to support the readiness and health of the force. [Army Move!](https://www.us.army.mil/suite/page/248187) is a standardized weight management program that provides useful nutrition and physical activity strategies to help the Army family achieve weight management success.\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?** \n\nA healthy and fit force is critical to the Army and national security. The Army has no greater mission than to help our Soldiers, retirees, family members and civilians, prevent disease and live healthier lives. Obesity increases risks for diabetes, cardio-vascular and heart disease, hypertension, cancer and many other related health conditions.  However,  these health risks can be prevented and controlled by making positive lifestyle choices. Maintaining a healthy body weight through good nutrition with a proper balance of sleep and activity is the key to disease prevention and a healthier life.    \n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nAs Army Medicine moves from a healthcare system to a system of health, our focus is on prevention of disease. The Army and Army Medicine will continue to encourage members of the Army family to make healthier choices to enhance the health, resiliency and readiness of the force. \n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [U.S. Army Public Health Command Healthy Living](http://phc.amedd.army.mil/topics/healthyliving/Pages/default.aspx)\n* [Army Weight Management Resources](http://phc.amedd.army.mil/topics/healthyliving/n/Pages/WeightManagement.aspx)\n* CAC log-in required: [Army Move!](https://www.us.army.mil/suite/page/248187)\n* Related article: [\"Performance Triad\" to change focus of Army Medicine](http://www.army.mil/article/88044/)\n",
