Topical feature articles, posters and videos provide leaders an opportunity to engage with their Soldiers on risk management, thereby reducing accidental injury and death. The campaign, which runs through Feb. 28, 2014, emphasizes prevention and vigilance and is driven by a theme asking all audiences to make safe decisions wherever their adventures take them.\n\nTopics include privately owned weapons, home safety, cold weather injury prevention, physical training, winter driving and winter sports/recreation. The complete campaign is available [online](https://safety.army.mil).\n\n**What efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nCooler temperatures and winter weather present persistent challenges for Soldiers and civilians operating in theater and at home. The Army team must remain aware of the hazards and stay engaged throughout this high-risk season.\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nThe [Know the Signs](https://safety.army.mil/multimedia/CAMPAIGNSINITIATIVES/KnowtheSigns/tabid/2369/Default.aspx) safety communication initiative includes four separate seasonal campaigns designed to encourage year-round risk management and assist unit and organization leaders, safety officers and NCOs in executing their safety programs. Campaign content, which sometimes includes non-seasonal items, will continue to heighten Soldier, family and civilian awareness of the risks associated with on- and off-duty activities. \n\n**Resources:** \n\n* [Brig.
