    "body": "**What is it?**\n\nU.S. Army South, as the Army's executive agent, will conduct bilateral staff talks with the El Salvador Army, August 12-15, in San Salvador, El Salvador. The U.S. Army Staff Talks Program serves as a bilateral forum for strategic-level discussions between respective armies. The Staff Talks Program seeks to promote bilateral efforts in order to develop professional partnerships and increase interaction between partner nation armies. \n\nThe engagements enhance army-to-army contacts and mutual understanding, providing the partner nation armies with insights concerning specific U.S. Army programs, areas of mutual interest, and assisting partner nation armies in areas of modernization or reform. \n\nThe overall objective of the U.S. Army Staff Talks Program in Latin America is to promote peace and stability in Central and South America, and the Caribbean through mutual understanding, partnership, and cooperation.\n\n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nThe U.S. Army has engaged in annual bilateral staff talks with the Salvadoran army for the past six years. The staff talks have been instrumental in enhancing the interoperability and cooperation between the two armies, which have contributed to increased stability in the region.\n\n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nThe goal during the staff talks is to develop a bilateral engagement plan with the Salvadoran army, which continues to strengthen its relationship with the U.S. Army. The two armies will develop knowledge, capabilities and support for current and future peace-keeping, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief and other combined operations. \n\nThe U.S. Army will continue to support El Salvador's army efforts to serve as an active leader in providing security, protecting human rights and promoting peace and stability. Their efforts in these staff talks will help increase interoperability with the U.S. military.   \n\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?** \n\nThe U.S. Army's capabilities in the region are greatly influenced by the partnerships forged with partner nation armies. Strengthening the relationship with the Salvadoran army through these talks will have lasting effects on the peace and stability of the region. With its highly capable military and law enforcement agencies serving as models of professionalism in the region, El Salvador is a key player in enhancing security in the region. \n\nAdditionally, the U.S. Army appreciates the significant contribution the Salvadoran army has made to coalition efforts in Iraq.  The Salvadoran army has deployed 12 rotations of soldiers to participate in Operation Iraqi Freedom.  \n\nThese important staff talks allow the U.S. Army and El Salvador to discuss opportunities to partner in the future.\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [U.S. Army South](http://www.arsouth.army.mil/)\n* Related: [STAND-TO!: The U.S. Army Staff Talks Program](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/issue.php?issue=2012-03-13)\n* [U.S. Army South on Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/ArmySouthp)\n* [U.S. Army South on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/usarmysouth)",
