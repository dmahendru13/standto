    "body": "**What is it?**\n\nWarrior Care Month, initiated in 2008, is observed by the military services each November.  This is a time to reaffirm a commitment to the care and support for wounded, ill or injured service members and their families.  The theme for this year's joint observance is *Warrior Care -  Building a Ready and Resilient Force.*\n\n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nThe [Warrior Transition Command](http://www.wtc.army.mil/)\n is the lead proponent for the [U.S. Army Warrior Care and Transition Program](http://wtc.army.mil/about_us/programs.html).  This program enables the Army to provide comprehensive support to wounded, ill or injured Soldiers through medical care, rehabilitation, professional development, and achievement of personal goals.\n\n**What efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nAcross the Army during November, Army leaders will host engagements highlighting the resilience and strength of wounded, ill or injured Soldiers, their families and the Warrior Transition Unit (WTU) cadre.   At Army installations and in local communities, Warrior Care Month observances will include open houses, media days, and adaptive sports and reconditioning events.  A joint-service sitting volleyball competition is planned for Nov.  21 in the Pentagon Athletic Center.  \n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nThe Army's Warrior Care and Transition Program helps Soldiers heal and teaches resilience and performance enhancement skills.  [Resilience and Performance Enhancement training](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-04-04/) is offered to WTU Soldiers, their families and to WTU Cadre at the Army's 29 WTUs and nine Community Based WTUs (CBWTUs) through local classes, workshops and mobile training teams. \n\nAdditionally, a Cadre Resilience Course to provide standardized [Resilience Training](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-09-13/) for new WTU and CBWTU Cadre was created by the Warrior Transition Command.  This course, approved by the Army's [Comprehensive Soldier and Family Fitness](http://csf2.army.mil/) Office, helps cadre develop skills to overcome challenges and to bounce back from adversity.  Another focus of the course is to help cadre understand how to mentor Soldiers in WTUs and to create a more resilient environment for healing and transition.\n\n[Warrior Care Month](http://www.wtc.army.mil/about_us/warrior_care_month_2013.html) is a time for the Army to celebrate the [resilience](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilience) and strength, the wounded, ill or injured Soldiers demonstrate every day, and to pay tribute to those who have sacrificed so much in the defense of the nation. \n\n\n**Resources:** \n\n* [Ready and Resilient- Transition](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient/transition)\n* [Warrior Transition Command](http://www.wtc.army.mil/)\n* [Warrior Care Month](http://www.wtc.army.mil/about_us/warrior_care_month_2013.html)\n* [Army Wounded Warrior Program (AW2)](http://www.wtc.army.mil/aw2/index.html)\n* [Comprehensive Soldier and Family Fitness](http://csf2.army.mil/)\n* Video: [Warrior Care Month Nov. 2013](http://www.dvidshub.net/video/303714/warrior-care-month-nov-2013#.UneSGxBU2a4)\n* Warrior Transition Command Social Media platforms: \n* &bull; [Twitter](http://twitter.com/armyWTC)\n* &bull; [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ArmyWTC)\n* &bull; [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/armywtc/)\n* Army Wounded Warrior Social Media platforms: \n* &bull; [Blogs](http://AW2.armylive.dodlive.mil)\n* &bull; [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Army-Wounded-Warrior-Program-AW2/109383282415297)\n* Related STAND-TO!: \n* &bull; [Warrior Transition Unit Resilience Training](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-09-13/)\n* &bull; [Warrior Transition Units Cadre Training Program]( http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-08-19/)\n\n\n\n\n",
