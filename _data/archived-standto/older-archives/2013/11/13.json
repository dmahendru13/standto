    "body": "**What is it?**\n\nThe [U.S. Army Installation Management Command](http://www.imcom.army.mil) has joined forces with the [Comprehensive Soldier & Family Fitness](http://csf2.army.mil/) program to provide family resilience training through Army Community Service Centers.  The program is designed to provide family members with the thinking skills and coping strategies needed to take care of themselves and their Soldier.  The master resilience trainers will support the [Comprehensive Soldier & Family Fitness program](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-07-23/)'s vision and goals by training specific resilience techniques to Army family members and Department of the Army civilians that increase physical, emotional, social, spiritual and family strengths. first-line leaders who ensure their Soldiers' healing and transition.\n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nSince August 2010, 281 master resilience trainers have been certified to conduct trainings for the garrison ACS family resilience programs across the Army.  These ACS staff members are graduates of the 10-day master resilience training course currently offered at sites sanctioned by the director of Comprehensive Soldier & Family Fitness program.  Although the target audience for resiliency training is family members, a total of 152,581 Soldiers, family members and DA civilians have been trained.  \n\n\n**What efforts does the Army have planned for the future?** \n\n[IMCOM](http://www.imcom.army.mil) ACS plans to continue offering resilience training to families as one of their many family support services.  The goal is for family resilience training to take place at every garrison.  To reach this goal, IMCOM will continue to encourage garrison ACS staff members to become certified master resilience trainers to help expand the program and train more families.  Family members can also continue to build their resilience with online tools (such as the [Global Assessment Tool](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/2011/02/04/) and the online self-development) that give Army families and DA civilians a new way to improve their overall fitness and resilience.  \n\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nThe Army recognizes that the strength of the Army is, in part, because of the support the Soldiers receive from their families.  By building the resilience of the total [Army family](http://army.mil/families), Army family members and DA civilians gain the skills to overcome hardships and adverse events so they are better able to cope with adversity and continue to be the pillar of support for the Soldiers. \n\n**Resources:** \n\n\n* [Ready and Resilient](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient)\n* [U.S. Army Installation Management Command](http://www.imcom.army.mil)\n* [U.S. Army Family & Morale, Welfare and Recreation Command](http://www.armymwr.com/)\n* [Comprehensive Soldier and Family Fitness](http://csf2.army.mil/)\n* [Army OneSource](http://www.myarmyonesource.com)\n* Related STAND-TO! : \n* &bull; [Ready and Resilient Campaign: Comprehensive Soldier and Family Fitness]( http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-07-23/)\n\n\n\n\n",
