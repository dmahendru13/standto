    "body": "**What is it?**\n\nThe U.S. Army's focus on a holistic recovery of wounded, ill or injured Soldiers includes empowering them for a successful reintegration, back in the force or to a civilian life as a veteran. The reintegration process begins as soon as a Soldier is ready to begin reintegration tasks and continues throughout the Soldier's time in the [Warrior Transition Unit](http://wtc.army.mil/about_us/wtu.html) (WTU). \n\nAs the Army observes [Warrior Care Month](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-11-04/?), Warrior Transition Command (WTC), as the lead proponent for the [Warrior Care and Transition Program](http://wtc.army.mil/about_us/programs.html),  focuses on the reintegration of wounded, ill and injured Soldiers.  These Soldiers enhance the [readiness](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient/transition) of the total force by building and developing their skills and actively achieving career goals. \n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nThe 7,700 Soldiers recovering at 29 Warrior Transition Units (WTUs) and nine Community-Based Warrior Transition Units (CBWTUs) set short- and long-term career goals as part of their personalized holistic recovery plans, or [Comprehensive Transition Plans]( http://www.wtc.army.mil/resources/WTC_CTP_Policy_Guidance_1DEC11.pdf).  Whether they're transitioning back to the force or onto civilian life, Soldiers have the opportunity to participate in [Career and Education Readiness (CER)]( http://wtc.army.mil/about_us/eei.html) programs.\n\nThose preparing to return to the force work towards required Soldier training for their current or new military occupational specialty (MOS).  Almost 50 percent of Soldiers supported by the Army's [Warrior Care and Transition Program](http://wtc.army.mil/about_us/programs.html)  since 2007 have returned to the force, with several redeploying after their recovery.  Those separating from the Army ready themselves  for the civilian workforce by preparing for college, taking college classes, earning certifications, and participating in professional internships at federal agencies.  \n\nMore than 500 WTU Soldiers have completed internships through *Operation Warfighter*, a DOD program, designed to allow recovering service members to intern at local federal agencies. Through OWF, Soldiers build professional experience, develop stronger networks, and enhance their understanding of the civilian workforce.\n\n**What efforts does the Army have planned for the future?** \n\nThe [Warrior Transition Command](http://www.wtc.army.mil/) is publishing Career and Education Readiness manuals on internships to strengthen these programs across the WTU structure.  WTC is also working to [educate](http://www.wtc.army.mil/employers/) civilian employers on the benefits of hiring wounded, ill and injured veterans and debunk the three key misperceptions among prospective employers through the [*Hire a Veteran* campaign](http://www.wtc.army.mil/video/hireaveteran.html). \n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nSince 2007, nearly half of the 57,000 Soldiers supported by WTUs have returned to duty, contributing to a ready and resilient force.  Those who transition out of the Army are better prepared to contribute to their communities as proud, productive veterans, representing the Army's commitment to a holistic recovery for every wounded, ill and injured Soldier.\n\n**Resources:** \n\n* Senior leaders message:[Tri-signed letter](http://www.army.mil/e2/c/downloads/319648.pdf)\n* [Army.mil: Ready and Resilient- Transition](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient/transition)\n* [U.S. Army Warrior Transition Command](http://www.wtc.army.mil/)\n* &bull; [Employment Resources]( http://www.wtc.army.mil/employers/index.html)\n* &bull; Video: [*Hire a Veteran* campaign](http://www.wtc.army.mil/video/hireaveteran.html)\n* [Army Wounded Warrior Program (AW2) ](http://www.wtc.army.mil/aw2/index.html)\n* [Army.mil: U.S. Army Veterans](http://www.army.mil/veterans/)\n* [Comprehensive Soldier and Family Fitness](http://csf2.army.mil/)\n* Warrior Transition Command Social Media platforms: \n* &bull; [Videos](http://www.wtc.army.mil/press_room/videos.html)\n* &bull; [Twitter](http://twitter.com/armyWTC)\n* &bull; [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ArmyWTC)\n* &bull; [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/armywtc/)\n* Related STAND-TO!: \n* &bull; [Warrior Care - Recovery and Rehabilitation](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-11-14/)\n* &bull; [Warrior Transition Command Cadre Resilience Course](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-11-12/)\n* &bull; [Warrior Care Month](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-11-04/?)\n* &bull; [Warrior Transition Unit Resilience Training](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-09-13/)\n* &bull; [Warrior Transition Units Cadre Training Program]( http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-08-19/)\n* &bull; [Ready and Resilient Campaign Update](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-07-15/)",
