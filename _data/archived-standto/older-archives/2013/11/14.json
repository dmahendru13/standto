    "body": "**What is it?**\n\nThe U.S. Army strives to retain members of the well-trained force and support Soldiers returning to duty whenever possible. The recovery and rehabilitation process helps the Soldiers complete periodic self-assessments that address areas for a holistic recovery. \n\nAs the Army observes [Warrior Care Month](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-11-04/?), [Warrior Transition Command](http://www.wtc.army.mil/) (WTC)  focuses  on the special programs designed to support the recovery and rehabilitation of wounded, ill and injured Soldiers recovering at [Warrior Transition Units](http://wtc.army.mil/about_us/wtu.html) (WTUs).\n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nSince 2007, the Army has given more than 57,000 wounded, ill and injured Soldiers the dedicated time and place to heal at [WTUs](http://wtc.army.mil/about_us/wtu.html).  Approximately 7,700 Soldiers currently recover at the 29 WTUs and nine Community-Based WTUs (CBWTUs).\n\nEach Soldier benefits from a *Triad of Care* to collaborate with an interdisciplinary team of medical and non-medical professionals to support the Soldier during every step of the recovery and transition process.  The *Triad of Care* refers to: \n\n* &bull; Primary care manager (healthcare provider) - plans, directs, and oversees the care.\n* &bull; Nurse case manager- coordinates the care\n* &bull; Squad Leader /Platoon Sergeant - leads the Soldier, enabling him/her to comply with CTP requirements\n\nTo ensure a holistic approach and recovery, each Soldier  develops a personalized [Comprehensive Transition Plan](http://www.wtc.army.mil/resources/WTC_CTP_Policy_Guidance_1DEC11.pdf)  with short- and long-term goals across six domains of life: physical, social, spiritual, emotional, family, and career. To meet these recovery goals and support their medical treatment plans, Soldiers actively work with professional cadre, including world-class physical and occupational therapists, social workers, clinical pharmacists  and Army Wounded Warrior Program [(AW2) Advocates](http://www.wtc.army.mil/aw2/advocates/index.html).  \n\nSoldiers participate in adaptive reconditioning activities whenever possible within their medical profiles, which promote resilience, responsibility, reliability, and opportunities to network with other recovering Soldiers. \n\nFamily members and caregivers are invited to all medical appointments and transition meetings and are encouraged to be actively involved in each Soldier's recovery.  \n\n  \n**What efforts does the Army have planned for the future?** \n\nThe Army will continue to provide wounded, ill and injured Soldiers the best possible care and support and to recruit the highest caliber professional cadre to support them.  \n\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nThe Army honors the service and sacrifice of every Soldier who wears the uniform and especially those who become wounded, ill or injured. \n\nWarrior care is an Army-wide responsibility. Warrior care aligns with the Army's [Ready and Resilient](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient) campaign which promotes strengthening of resilience and improving the readiness across the total force. This effort assists in reinforcing the [Army Profession](http://cape.army.mil/). \n\n**Resources:** \n\n\n* [Army.mil: Ready and Resilient- Transition](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient/transition)\n* [Warrior Transition Command](http://www.imcom.army.mil)\n* [Warrior Care Month](http://www.armymwr.com/)\n* [Army Wounded Warrior Program (AW2)](http://www.wtc.army.mil/aw2/index.html)\n* [Comprehensive Soldier and Family Fitness](http://csf2.army.mil/)\n* Warrior Transition Command Social Media platforms: \n* &bull; [Videos](http://www.wtc.army.mil/press_room/videos.html)\n* &bull; [Twitter](http://twitter.com/armyWTC)\n* &bull; [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ArmyWTC)\n* &bull; [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/armywtc/)\n* Army Wounded Warrior Social Media platforms:\n* &bull; [Blogs](http://AW2.armylive.dodlive.mil)\n* &bull; [Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Army-Wounded-Warrior-Program-AW2/109383282415297)\n* Related STAND-TO!: \n* &bull; [Warrior Care Month](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-11-04/?)\n* &bull; [Warrior Transition Unit Resilience Training](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-09-13/)\n* &bull; [Warrior Transition Units Cadre Training Program]( http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-08-19/)\n* &bull; [Ready and Resilient Campaign Update](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-07-15/)\n\n\n\n\n",
