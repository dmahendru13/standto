    "body": "**What is it?**\n\nMilitary Family Appreciation Month is observed every November to recognize and honor Army families for their contributions and sacrifices.  The Army recognizes that the selfless dedication and commitment of Army families directly contributes to the readiness of our Soldiers.  Families are the force behind the force.   \n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nMilitary Family Appreciation Month was established in 1993 by the  [Armed Services YMCA](http://www.asymca.org/).  The U.S. Government has recognized the occasion every year since.  Throughout the month of November, community leaders, businesses and garrisons are teaming up to recognize Army families through a variety of activities such as family fun nights, fun runs, discounts at Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) facilities, sporting events and special recognitions during community activities.  Active, Guard, and Reserve leaders are being joined by Department of Defense organizations such as the Army Air Force Exchange Service and the Defense Commissary Agency to conduct activities and events to express their appreciation and thanks to our military families\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nArmy families are important because the strength of our Soldiers comes from the strength of their families.  Families are a vital part of the Army's ability to remain strong.  With thousands of Soldiers deployed, families have never wavered in their support and patriotism, despite the many challenges they have faced.  During the month of November, all commands, installations, and units are encouraged to support local engagements designed to draw public attention and illustrate public support and appreciation and thanks to the Army family.  \n\n\n**What efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nMilitary Family Appreciation Month complements the [Ready and Resilient]( http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient)  campaign which supports the efforts of programs that strengthen the resilience and readiness of Army families.  The Army is fully committed to helping families remain Army strong by offering a variety of programs and services through the garrison MWR programs, Army Community Services and Child Youth and School Services.   These programs keep the Army's commitment to provide Soldiers and their families a quality of life commensurate with their service resulting in families feeling important, supported and connected to the Army and the nation.\n\n**Resources:** \n\n* [Presidential Proclamation - Military Family Month, 2013](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/10/31/presidential-proclamation-military-family-month-2013)\n* [U.S. Army Ready and Resilient](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient)\n* [Army Installation Management Command](http://www.imcom.army.mil)\n* [U.S. Army Family & Morale, Welfare and Recreation Command](http://www.armymwr.com/)\n* [Army OneSource](http://www.myarmyonesource.com) \n* [National Military Family Association](http://www.militaryfamily.org/feature-articles/)\n\n\n\n",

For their country and their loved ones, they rise to the challenges of multiple deployments and frequent moves -- spouses who care and provide for children in their partners' absence, kids who make new friends and leave known comforts behind. They are the force behind the force, patriots who support their family members in uniform while enriching the communities they call home.\n \n### - President Barack Obama, in the presidential proclamation on Military Family Month, 2013 \n\n### Read the entire [Proclamation](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/10/31/presidential-proclamation-military-family-month-2013)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n",
