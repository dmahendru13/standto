    "body": "**What is it?**\n\nNov. 11, 1918, is generally considered the end of World War I, The Great War, and \"the war to end war\". In 1938, Congress declared Armistice Day a holiday, and, in 1954, the name changed to Veterans Day to honor all [U.S. Veterans](http://www.army.mil/veterans). Honoring veterans on November 11 preserves the historical significance of the date and helps focus attention on its purpose to honor America's veterans for their patriotism, and willingness to serve and sacrifice for freedom. The Army's theme for Veterans Day 2013 is: *Once a Soldier, Always a Soldier. Soldier for Life.*   \n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nThe U.S. Army is committed to preparing Soldiers and their [families](http://www.army.mil/families) for lifelong success by connecting them with opportunities for employment, education and healthcare during and after their military service. To meet the President's call for a career-ready military, the federal government has developed a training and services delivery model to strengthen service members' transition to civilian life, allowing them to Remain Strong while serving in their communities. To answer that call, the Army continues to improve the [Army Career & Alumni Program](https://www.acap.army.mil/about-acap.aspx.htm), which provides transition assistance workshops and resources throughout the year.\n\n\n**What efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nThe Army continues to strengthen its efforts to honor, recognize and help Soldiers in their transition to civilian life by collaborating with the [U.S. Department of Labor](http://www.dol.gov/vets/programs/tap/tap_fs.htm#.UJzqg5EWkdk) and [U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs](http://www.va.gov/). It also looks to connect them  to employment, education and healthcare resources available through organizations, industry, and local communities. Honoring America's veterans includes supporting them long after their military service has ended.\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nThe Army's all volunteer force serves with distinction in peacetime and wartime. Under difficult circumstances, Soldiers sacrifice to meet the needs of the nation. As grateful citizens, the nation is responsible for ensuring that all veterans are prepared and equipped to reintegrate as civic members, leaders and role models into the communities. [Army Veterans'](http://www.army.mil/veterans) leadership experience, teamwork ethic and results-focus are valuable to any organization. Veterans have added proud chapters to the story of America, not only on the battlefield, but also in communities from coast to coast.
