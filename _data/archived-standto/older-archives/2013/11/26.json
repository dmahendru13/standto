    "body": "**What is it?** \n\nThe [Survivor Outreach Services](http://www.sos.army.mil/) (SOS) program is a \"One Army\" Program that serves as the long-term support portion of the overall Army casualty continuum of care.  From very early on in the casualty process, active Army, [Army National Guard](http://www.arng.army.mil/Pages/Default.aspx) and [United States Army Reserve](http://www.usar.army.mil/Pages/default.aspx) support coordinators and financial counselors work together as an integrated team to provide dedicated and comprehensive support services to all surviving family members, regardless of service component, cause, or location of death.  SOS honors their sacrifice and assures survivors that they remain part of the Army family for as long as they desire.\n\n**What has the  Army done**\n\nAvailable in all 54 states/territories, Europe and the Pacific, SOS support coordinators and financial counselors provide services through active case management and are advocates for survivors. \n\n* &bull; **Support Coordinators**: assess needs, coordinate services and events, ensure benefits and entitlements milestones are tracked, facilitate non-clinical support groups and provide information and referral services. Support coordinators also develop partnerships with other organizations to assist and leverage support for survivors (i.e., Behavioral Health Clinics/providers, Military Family Life Consultants, Department of Human Services, Vet Centers, Social Security Administration, local churches, etc) to maximize available resources and ensure that identified needs are met.\n\n* &bull; **Financial Counselors**: are committed to assisting survivors in creating financial independence and ensuring they have the information and confidence needed to make sound financial decisions. Financial counselors provide education on investing, estate planning, tax issues and assist in establishing long term financial goals.  They further offer professional level services addressing money management issues (i.e., tax considerations, advanced directives, wills, etc) because of their familiarity with survivor entitlements and the associated tax implications.\n\n**What efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nAs the Army's official program, SOS embraces and reassures survivors that they are continually linked to the Army family for as long as they desire.  Therefore, SOS services have no expiration date and survivors can access the program at any time a need arises.  SOS will remain a resource for survivors and continue to evolve services to meet their needs.  \n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nNothing reflects the Army's dedication to those who have given the ultimate sacrifice than the service and care for their families left behind. SOS fulfills the Army's commitment to survivors and honors the legacy of their fallen loved one.  \n\n**Resources:** \n\n* [Survivor Outreach Services](http://www.sos.army.mil/) \n* [U.S. Army Installation Management Command](http://www.army.mil/info/organization/unitsandcommands/commandstructure/imcom/)\n* Army.mil: [Army Families](http://www.army.mil/families)\n* Army.mil: [Gold Star Mothers](http://www.army.mil/goldstarmothers/)\n* [SOS on Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sos.headquarters)\n*  SOS toll-free number (1-855-707-2769) \n*  Related STAND-TO!\n* &bull; [Army Family Action Plan](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-08-14/)  ",
