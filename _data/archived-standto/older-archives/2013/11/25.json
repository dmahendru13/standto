    "body": "**What is it?** \n\nThe program of instruction, or POI, is the primary document that captures content (curriculum) and resources for Army-instructed courses. The POI includes the curriculum and information needed to determine funding, manpower, land, ranges, simulations, automation, facilities, classrooms and other resources. Keeping POIs current and relevant is critical to ensuring the Army resources the training Soldiers require. \n\nThe Automated Program of Instruction, or APOI, will enable [U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/) (TRADOC)  to improve management of training and resources by automating the POI process and improving the Army's ability to more accurately program and resource Army-instructed courses.\n\nThe APOI initiative has five efforts:\n\n* &bull; Fully automating TRADOC's oversight and management of POIs and other [Training Resource Analysis System](https://atn.army.mil/TreeViewCScrosswalk.aspx?loadTierID=2957&docID=34), or TRAS, changes\n* &bull; Fully automating center of excellence/school TRAS development, staffing and analysis\n* &bull; Linking POIs to an enterprise scheduling system across TRADOC so centers of excellence and schools can better manage available training resources\n* &bull; Developing and providing training and education data to support Army resourcing systems and Total Army Analysis [(PDF)](http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r71_11.pdf)\n* &bull; Providing training and education data to and from the operational Army\n\n**What has the  Army done**\n\nIn August 2012, the Army secretary endorsed TRADOC's recommendation to \"drive precision in training and education systems.\" As part of this, TRADOC established an APOI integrated process team and began to develop the APOI concept and effort.  \n\nTRADOC is working other key Army stakeholders to pursue process improvements that will drive greater precision in the POI development and Structure Manning Decision Review processes. \n\n**What efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nTRADOC's G-3/5/7 [Training Operations Management Activity](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/g357/toma/index.htm) will continue to refine APOI efforts in coordination with key stakeholders. Army Materiel Command's [Communications-Electronics Command](http://cecom.army.mil/), assisted by the Army Training Support Activity, will provide technical support to automate and enable the APOI effort. \n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nDirected by the Army secretary as a result of an Institutional Education and Training Reforms Study, the TRADOC-led APOI initiative will increase efficiency in TRADOC's management of institutional training and resources.  The APOI effort automates the development of a multifunctional and synchronized approach to Army training management systems. This will improve linkages to Army resourcing systems and ensure resources are better managed to support Army priorities. \n\nIn a resource-constrained environment, the Army must be as precise as possible when determining requirements and resourcing, in order to reduce the potential for unfunded requirements. The APOI will provide a tool to more effectively manage training resources and assist trainers and leaders in making resource-informed decisions.\n\n**Resources:** \n\n* [U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/)\n* [TRADOC G-3/5/7 (Operations/ Plans and Training)](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/g357/)\n* [Army Training Network](https://atn.army.mil)\n* [Army Materiel Command](http://www.army.mil/info/organization/unitsandcommands/commandstructure/amc/)\n* AKO log-in required:\n* &bull; [TRADOC Report on Institutional Education and Training Reforms Study](https://www.us.army.mil/suite/doc/39587538)\n* &bull; [APOI References](https://www.us.army.mil/suite/folder/39587470)\n* &bull; [Training Operations Management Activity](https://ako.us.army.mil/suite/page/683555)\n* Related PDF:\n* &bull; [TP 525-8-2: The U.S. Army Learning Concept- 2015](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/tpubs/pams/tp525-8-2.pdf)\n* &bull; [TR 350-70: *Army Learning Policy and Systems*](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/tpubs/regs/tr350-70.pdf)\n* &bull; [AR 71-11: *Total Army Analysis*](http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r71_11.pdf)\n* Related STAND-TO!:\n* &bull; [2013 Army Campaign of Learning](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/issue.php?issue=2012-09-21)\n* &bull; [The Army Learning Concept - 2015](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/2010/10/19/)\n\n",
