    "body": "*Each November since 2008 the military departments observe 'Warrior Care Month\" as a time to highlight our deep and abiding commitment to the care of and support for our wounded, ill and injured service members and their families.  These men and women have sacrificed greatly as vital members of our military community.  Through their recovery, we find in them role models as we strive to build a strong, ready and resilient force.*\n\n*Today, more than 90 percent of Soldiers who are wounded in combat survive their injuries.  Caring for them from the point of injury on the battlefield until they return home to heal, surrounded by the love and support of family and friends is our sacred obligation.  Since 2007, approximately 50 percent of our wounded, ill and injured Soldiers have successfully returned to the force after being cared for in [Warrior Transition Units](http://wtc.army.mil/about_us/wtu.html) (WTUs).  For our veterans who do leave military service, we do all we can through education and employment assistance to ensure they are well prepared to lead productive lives in their communities.   We know that our [veterans](http://www.army.mil/veterans/) often serve as community leaders, bringing home with them the values we live by in the Army.  They make us proud.*\n\n*The Army's [Warrior Care and Transition Program](http://wtc.army.mil/about_us/programs.html)  helps Soldiers and their families heal while also teaching resilience and performance enhancement skills. Soldiers and families, along with cadre at the Army's 29 WTUs and 9 Community-Based Warrior Transition Units (CBWTUs) learn through classes, workshops and mobile training teams.  Additionally, the [Warrior Transition Command](http://www.wtc.army.mil/) implemented a [Cadre Resilience Course](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-11-12/) to provide standardized resilience training to new WTU and CBWTU cadre. This course, approved by the Army's [Comprehensive Soldier and Family Fitness](http://csf2.army.mil/) office, helps cadre develop critical thinking, knowledge and skills to overcome challenges  and rebound from adversity.  Another focus of the course is to help cadre understand how to mentor Soldiers in WTUs, and to create a more resilient environment for healing and [transition](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient/transition).  Together, these efforts-nested in the Army's [Ready and Resilient](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient) Campaign-are making a difference.*\n\n*[Warrior Care Month](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-11-04/)  is a time to tell the story of these courageous Soldiers.  Please join us in paying tribute to those who have sacrificed so much in the defense of our nation. As we continue to care for these warriors today - and every day - we should celebrate their resilience and their strength.
