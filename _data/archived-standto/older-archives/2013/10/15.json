    "quote": "Focus Quote for the Day\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith the Afghans, one cannot overtly lead -- they are their own military, independently run by their own leadership, but you can also influence them with advice and your presence. Show your professionalism to them, then you exhibit leadership when they don't even know it's there. They'll follow your example, your character, so was I leading anyone? No. Was I offering an example for them to follow, yes. \n\n### - Medal of Honor Recipient Former Capt. William D.
