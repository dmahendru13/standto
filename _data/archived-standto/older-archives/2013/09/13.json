    "body": "**What is it?**\n\nThe [U.S. Army Ready and Resilient campaign](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient/) defines resilience as: The mental, physical, emotional, and behavioral ability to face and cope with adversity, adapt to change, recover, learn and grow from setbacks. \n\n[Army Warrior Care and Transition Program](http://wtc.army.mil/about_us/programs.html) (WCTP) leaders recognized early on that providing resilience and performance enhancement training to wounded, ill, or injured Soldiers and to the cadre who support them is a vital part of the recovery and [transition](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient/transition)  process.  [Comprehensive Soldier and Family Fitness](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-07-23/) (CSF2) resilience and performance enhancement skills training is provided to Soldiers and Cadre located at the Army's 29 [Warrior Transition Units](http://wtc.army.mil/about_us/wtu.html) (WTU) and nine Community Based WTUs.  The combined efforts of unit Master Resilience Trainers and [CSF2 Training Center](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-04-04/) (TC) staff makes this training possible in WTUs. \n\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?** \n\nIncreasing [resilience](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient/) and learning skills to enhance performance in all areas of life is especially important to Soldiers overcoming physical and emotional adversity.  Building and improving resilience in Soldiers transitioning back to the force or out of military service supports Army readiness and promotes success as a [veteran](http://www.army.mil/veterans).   \n\n**What is the  Army doing?** \n\nThe WCTP, in liaison with the [CSF2](http://csf2.army.mil/), incorporates standardized resilience and performance enhancement training into each Soldier's [Comprehensive Transition Plan](http://wtc.army.mil/about_us/ctp.html). Soldiers assigned to WTUs receive performance enhancement training between days 31-90 of their transition process.  Training is taught quarterly by local CSF2 TC staff, or through [mobile training teams](http://www.army.mil/article/102040/). Warrior Transition cadre members also require the resilience and mental toughness necessary to meet the extensive demands of a care giving role. The [Warrior Transition Command](http://www.wtc.army.mil), in liaison with the [Army Medical Department Center & School](http://www.cs.amedd.army.mil/), established resilience training for all incoming cadre as part of their resident course training. This helps improve their personal levels of resilience and carries over into a mentorship capacity as they train Soldiers to become more resilient and to build the skills necessary to transition successfully.   \n\n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nResilience training is a critical element in the recovery and transition process of wounded, ill and injured Soldiers and Army leaders remain committed to building a ready and resilient force. \n\n\n**Resources**\n\n* [Ready and Resilient- Transition](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient/transition)\n* [Warrior Transition Command](http://www.wtc.army.mil)\n* [Comprehensive Soldier and Family Fitness](http://csf2.army.mil/)\n* [Army Warrior Care and Transition Program](http://wtc.army.mil/about_us/programs.html) \n* [Comprehensive Transition Plan](http://wtc.army.mil/about_us/ctp.html)\n* Related STAND-TO!: \n* &bull; [Ready and Resilient Update](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-07-15/)\n* &bull; [Ready and Resilient Campaign](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-03-13/)\n* &bull; [Comprehensive Soldier and Family Fitness](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-07-23/)\n* &bull; [Comprehensive Soldier and Family Fitness Training Centers](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-04-04/)\n\n\n",

What we aim to do in the Army, through the train-the-trainer program, is train our whole team on these resilience skills and increase everybody's level of resilience ... We're talking about changing behavior, and life skills. We're talking about changing a culture, a generation. That takes time. It's not going to happen overnight. \n \n\n### - Col.
