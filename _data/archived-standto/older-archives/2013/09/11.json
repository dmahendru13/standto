    "body": "*Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, we have all sacrificed- as individuals, as communities, as an Army and as a nation.  Nearly 3,000 people lost their lives that tragic day 12 years ago, more than 6,600 American service members have made the ultimate sacrifice since then, and countless other lives have been deeply touched by these losses.*\n\n*During what has become the longest period of sustained combat in American history, our men and women in uniform have shouldered the heavy burden of adapting to the challenges of war, which are unimaginable to most.  They stand as true patriots each day, defending our country with untiring devotion.  Surrounding and supporting our Soldiers stand our [civilians,](http://cape.army.mil/civilians.php) [families](http://www.army.mil/families) and [veterans](http://www.army.mil/veterans) whose service and patriotism is inspirational.*\n\n*We are an Army shaped by these historic events, united in our shared sacrifice and our spirit of service.  Together we have become more [resilient](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient); together we have become Army Strong!  This year, let us lend our strength and our compassion as we pay tribute to the victims of 9/11, as we honor those who responded, and as we thank those who unite in service to defend this great nation.*\n\nView the Army senior leaders tri-signed letter: [Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance](http://www.army.mil/e2/c/downloads/311708.pdf) \n\n**Related:**\n\n* &bull; [Presidential Proclamation](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/09/06/presidential-proclamation-national-days-prayer-and-remembrance-2013)\n* U.S. Army sites: \n* &bull; [Ready and Resilient](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient)\n* &bull; [Army Profession](http://cape.army.mil/aaop/)\n* &bull; [Soldier for Life](http://www.army.mil/soldierforlife/)\n* &bull; [Patriot Day](http://www.army.mil/patriotday/)\n* Related STAND-TO!: \n*  &bull; [Patriot Day: National Day of Service and Remembrance](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/issue.php?issue=2012-09-11)\n* &bull; [Army Values](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-08-15/)\n* &bull; [Ready and Resilient Update](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-07-15/)\n* &bull; [Ready and Resilient Campaign](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-03-13/)\n* &bull; [America's Army - Our Profession](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/issue.php?issue=2013-01-17)",
