    "body": "**What is it?**\n\nThe U.S. Army's strategic imperative of sustaining the all volunteer Army is directly affected by how well veterans reintegrate back into the communities and assist the Army in recruiting the next greatest generation of Americans willing to be Army Strong. \n\nThe [Soldier for Life](http://www.army.mil/soldierforlife/) program is a holistic approach to the entire Soldier lifecycle.  The U.S. Army takes care of all Soldiers by ensuring they *start strong, serve strong, reintegrate strong and remain strong* by serving their communities as [Soldiers for Life](http://www.army.mil/soldierforlife/)  in the Guard, Reserve and after they leave the Army.   \n\n**What has the Army done?** \n\nThe Army implemented programs throughout the Soldier lifecycle so they remain Army Strong.  Our Soldiers start strong with a positive image of the Army profession and connected to future employers through the [Partnership for Youth Success](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/issue.php?issue=2012-08-14) program.  They serve strong in their military occupation specialty (MOS) and as leaders using the [Army Career Tracker](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-04-16) and Credentialing Opportunities Online tools to manage their careers and self-development.  \n\nSoldiers reintegrate strong into the Guard, Reserve, or out of the Army using the improved [Transition Assistance Program]( http://www.army.mil/article/87766/), leveraging a single [Hero 2 Hired](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/issue.php?issue=2012-03-23) [website](https://h2h.jobs/), to find employment and using a network of Army mentors across America.  The Soldiers remain Army Strong as [veterans](http://www.army.mil/veterans), serving as business, government, and community leaders and as ambassadors for the Army.  \n\n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\n[Soldier for Life](http://www.army.mil/soldierforlife/)(SFL) will continue to support Army, government, and community efforts to reintegrate the Soldiers and their families.  SFL will sustain the campaign on what it means to be Soldiers today and veterans tomorrow.  SFL will continue to work with TRADOC to develop and expand credentialing opportunities and apprenticeships that will streamline the process for Soldiers to convert military training into civilian certifications and licenses.  SFL provides holistic support to the Soldier lifecycle and [Army profession](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/issue.php?issue=2012-04-16).\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?** \n\nThe long-term sustainability of the all volunteer Army depends on taking care of all Soldiers.  This also supports successful re-structuring as our Soldiers continue to transition out of the Army, and this is a tremendous opportunity for communities to strengthen themselves using the talent of the veterans.  SFL helps [veterans](http://www.army.mil/veterans)  bridge the gap from service through reintegration into the communities where the Army veterans will continue to serve as Soldiers for Life - Army Strong! \n\n\n\n**Resources**\n\n* [Ready and Resilient- Transition](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient/transition)\n* [Soldier for Life](http://www.army.mil/soldierforlife/)\n* [U.S. Army Veterans](http://www.army.mil/veterans)\n* [Army.mil: Resources for Veterans](http://www.army.mil/info/armylife/veterans/)\n* [Veterans Opportunity to Work Act (VOW Act)](http://veterans.house.gov/job)\n* [U.S. Army Reserve Employer Partnership Office](http://www.usar.army.mil/employerpartnership)\n* [National Guard Family Program](https://www.jointservicessupport.org/fp/default.aspx)\n* [Hero 2 Hired](https://h2h.jobs/)\n* [Army Career & Alumni Program ](https://www.acap.army.mil/acap-program.aspx.htm)\n* Related STAND-TO!: \n* &bull; [Soldier for Life](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/issue.php?issue=2012-11-13)\n* &bull; [Ready and Resilient Update](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-07-15/)\n* &bull; [Ready and Resilient Campaign](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-03-13/)\n* &bull; [Army Career and Alumni Program Centers](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-02-28/)\n*  &bull; [Hero 2 Hired](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/issue.php?issue=2012-03-23)\n*  &bull; [Veterans Day 2012 - Soldier for Life](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/issue.php?issue=2012-11-09)\n*  &bull; [Army Transition Policy Initiative](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/issue.php?issue=2011-12-07)\n* Related article:\n*  &bull; [New transition assistance program ready for rollout](http://www.army.mil/article/87766/)\n\n\n",
