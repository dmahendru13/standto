Its mission, along with RDECOM Americas and RDECOM Pacific, is to:  \n\n* Enable decisive overmatch by conducting Science and Technology collaboration \n* Search for new technologies for Soldiers\n* Facilitate interoperability among allies \n* Support research to develop capabilities and partnerships that support Warfighters.\n\n**What are the current and past efforts of the Army?**\n\nEach REDCOM FEC has International Technology Centers with several missions to: \n \n* Identify opportunities to promote research and technology discovery with international academic and research institutions\n* Support the Army's International Armaments Cooperation mission\n* Build partner capacity and interoperability by supporting military-to-military engagements \n\nThe RFECs have Field Assistance in Science and Technology advisors embedded with Army service component commands. RDECOM Atlantic FAST advisors support U. S. Army Europe and Africa and provide commanders with immediate and reach-back access to RDECOM scientists and engineers, in order to resolve capability gaps and expedite technology solutions to the Warfighter.  \n\nRDECOM has shifted its focus to support the Army's six modernization priorities: \n\n* [Long Range Precision Fires](https://www.army.mil/standto/2018-01-17) \n* [Next Generation Combat Vehicle](https://www.army.mil/standto/2018-02-22)  \n* [Future Vertical Lift](https://www.army.mil/standto/2018-02-07)\n* [Army Network](https://www.army.mil/standto/2018-03-08)\n* [Air and Missile Defense](https://www.army.mil/standto/2018-03-14)  \n* [Soldier Lethality](https://www.army.mil/standto/2018-03-22) \n\nThese modernization priorities provide the framework to build a ready Army, the Army's first priority. In support, RDECOM Atlantic scientists and engineers foster and maintain relationships with a science and technology community that includes 110 nations in Europe, Africa and the former Soviet Union.\n\n**What are the continued efforts planned by the Army?**\n\nThe Army will continue to seek and identify the best scientific research and technologies with global partners to more rapidly mature developments and close Warfighter capability gaps. It will ensure a balanced, global posture by engaging with emerging countries, building partner capacity, bolstering regional stability and supporting economic prosperity.  \n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nRDECOM's global engagement efforts are critical to ensuring the Army stays current with the latest technology developments around the world. Through the integration of its global resources and by leveraging innovation, RDECOM will continue to deliver relevant and revolutionary capabilities to the Warfighter.  \n\n**Resources**:\n\n* [U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command](https://www.army.mil/rdecom)\n* [RDECOM-FAST](https://www.rdecom.army.mil/FAST/)\n\n**Related STAND-TO!**:\n\n* [Army Modernization Strategy](https://www.army.mil/standto/2018-06-06)\n* [Army Futures Command](https://www.army.mil/standto/2018-03-28)\n* [Long Range Precision Fires](https://www.army.mil/standto/2018-01-17) \n* [Next Generation Combat Vehicle](https://www.army.mil/standto/2018-02-22)  \n* [Future Vertical Lift](https://www.army.mil/standto/2018-02-07)\n* [Army Network](https://www.army.mil/standto/2018-03-08)\n* [Air and Missile Defense](https://www.army.mil/standto/2018-03-14)  \n* [Soldier Lethality](https://www.army.mil/standto/2018-03-22) \n\n**Related article**: \n\n* [RDECOM-Atlantic](https://www.army.mil/article/157971/)\n\n\n",
