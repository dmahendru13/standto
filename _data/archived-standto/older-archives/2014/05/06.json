[Department of the Army Civilians](http://cpol.army.mil/) are required to complete an assessment prior to official travel or Permanent Change of Station (PCS). \n\nThrough TRiPS, users respond to a series of standard questions based on their vehicle type and other travel data. The system then calculates risk levels and presents the user with actual reports from accidents that occurred under similar circumstances, followed by possible mitigation strategies. A final risk calculation is performed according to selected mitigation measures, and the user is presented with supplemental materials including driving directions and a map to his or her destination. The assessment and a partially completed leave form are then submitted to the user's supervisor for approval.\n\n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nThe [U.S. Army Combat Readiness/Safety Center](https://safety.army.mil) released a significant upgrade to TRiPS in early May 2014. New features include:\n\n* -- User load capability\n* -- Department of Army/Department of Defense security compliance\n* -- Update and edit accident summaries\n* -- Re-designate organization for Joint Service environment\n* -- Road construction, weather and hazard notification\n* -- Mapping upgrade with support service interface\n* -- Multi-leg, round-trip and one-way travel\n* -- Recreational vehicle and trailer towing planner\n* -- Improved user email compatibility\n* -- Additional TRiPS reports\n* -- Assessment completion time\n* -- Smartphone applications (coming soon)\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?** \n \n\nDuring fiscal 2013, only eight percent of active duty Army Private Motor Vehicle (POV) fatalities, occurring more than 150 miles from home installation, happened during TRiPS-assessed travel. Since its inception, Soldiers have completed more than 10 million TRiPS assessments, which is instrumental in reducing fatalities. \n\nAll branches of the U.S. armed forces have adopted TRiPS, recognizing its ability to promote engagement between leaders and subordinates regarding driving safety. This interaction is vital in saving lives and preventing needless accidents wherever the Army operates.\n \n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [U.S. Army Combat Readiness/Safety Center](http://armymedicine.mil/pages/home.aspx)\n* [TRiPS](https://safety.army.mil/povtoolbox/HeadedOut/TravelRiskPlanningSystemTRiPS/tabid/1638/Default.aspx)\n* [POV Safety Board](https://safety.army.mil/povtoolbox/Safety101/POVSafetyBoard/tabid/1631/Default.aspx)\n\n\n",
