    "body": "**What is it?** \n\nTo provide wounded, ill and injured Soldiers greater ownership of their recovery and transition, the [Warrior Transition Command (WTC)](http://www.wtc.army.mil/) launched a [new public website](http://www.wtc.army.mil/wtc/aboutUs.html) that provides robust, detailed information on the Warrior Care and Transition Program (WCTP).\n\nIn the digital world of the 21st century, advocating for wounded, ill and injured Soldiers means that everyone needs virtual access to resources.  The new WTC website's responsive design enables Soldiers to easily access information on smartphones, tablets and computers no matter where they are in the recovery and transition process.\n\n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nWTC engaged with Warrior Transition Unit (WTU) Soldiers and cadre to get direct input to shape the new website. The site now allows users to easily navigate information by topic of interest, stage of recovery and/or role in the transition process.\n  \nExperts from WTC, WTUs and the U.S. Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) provided information for the site's new pages on a variety of topics that Soldiers, families and cadre asked for.  These topics include: [Special Compensation for Assistance with Activities of Daily Living (SCAADL),](http://wtc.army.mil/modules/soldier/s7-scaadl.html) [non-medical attendants (NMA),](http://wtc.army.mil/modules/soldier/s9-nonMedical.html) [adaptive reconditioning,](http://www.wtc.army.mil/modules/soldier/s5-adaptiveReconditioning.html) [internships,](http://www.wtc.army.mil/modules/soldier/s3-internships.html) [WTU transfer/exit criteria,](http://www.wtc.army.mil/modules/soldier/s1-wctpProgram.html) [cadre roles and responsibilities](http://www.wtc.army.mil/modules/cadre/c2-rolesResponsibilities.html) and many more.\n\nThe website's new [policy library](http://wtc.army.mil/documents/policies.html) provides quick and easy access to policies set forth by the Department of Defense, U.S. Army, MEDCOM and the Warrior Care and Transition Program (WCTP).  \n\nView the WTC public website redesign [fact sheet](http://www.wtc.army.mil/documents/factsheets/virtual_proponency_launch_fact_sheet.pdf) for more information. \n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nClear lines of communication and easy access to comprehensive real-time information are vital components of the recovery and transition process for wounded, ill and injured Soldiers and their families. \n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n \n[WTC](http://www.wtc.army.mil/) is always looking for ways to improve the value of the WCTP. WTC will continue to add value to the newly designed public website by providing robust information on additional topics of interest throughout 2014.
