    "body": "**What is it?** \n\nMartin Luther King Day, held on the third Monday of January, celebrates the life and achievements of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The U.S. Army senior leaders encourage the entire Army family to use Martin Luther King Day as an opportunity to engage in community activities to help others in need. \n\nDr. King remains an iconic figure, evidenced by the tens of thousands who came to Washington D.C. to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the historic march on Washington and his [\"I Have a Dream\" speech](http://www.archives.gov/press/exhibits/dream-speech.pdf).\n  \nThe passage of time has only served to deepen the nation's understanding of the importance of Dr. King's words and of his life's work.  Americans across the country will honor his teachings of nonviolence and equal rights by observing this national holiday; many will close their businesses for the day to devote that time to a national day of community service.  \n  \n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nMartin Luther King Day symbolizes the nation's commitment to a society based on the principles of freedom, justice and equality for all people.  As the *Strength of the Nation*, the United States Army works every day to achieve the dream envisaged by Dr. King a half century ago.  The Army strives to lead the nation by embracing the strengths of diverse people in an inclusive environment.  Soldiers join the  force each year, standing shoulder to shoulder and endeavor to follow Dr. King's example and honor his memory by reaffirming the commitment to the ideals he championed.  \n \n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nThe Army is  \"Army Strong\" not only because it places great value in having different perspectives, approaches, and skills but also because it values the ethnic and cultural diversity in the ranks.  Throughout the year, the Army will celebrate and commemorate the diversity of the Army and leverage and draw strength from the rich diversity within the military and civilian ranks by recognizing the critical roles all play in strengthening the nation's presence around the world. \n\n\n**Resources:**\n \n* [Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Service](http://mlkday.gov/)\n* [The Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change](http://www.thekingcenter.org/)\n* [African Americans in the U.S. Army](http://www.army.mil/africanamericans/)\n* MLK's speech- *I have a Dream*:\n* &bull; [PDF format](http://www.archives.gov/press/exhibits/dream-speech.pdf)\n* &bull; [Audio](http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/documentsentry/doc_august_28_1963_i_have_a_dream)\n* Messages: \n* &bull; Army senior leader tri-signed: [2014 Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Tri-Signed Letter](http://www.army.mil/e2/c/downloads/327668.pdf)\n* &bull; Lt.
