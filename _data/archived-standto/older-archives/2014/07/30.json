    "body": "**What is it?**\n\nThe [Chief of Staff of the Army (CSA)](http://www.army.mil/leaders/csa/) hosts the inaugural Army Profession Symposium at West Point, New York,  July 30-31, 2014. The symposium's purpose is to develop a shared vision, reinforce guidance, and generate dialogue on \"Living the Army Ethic.\" Attendees will review the [Army Ethic White Paper](http://cape.army.mil/repository/white-papers/Army-Ethic-White-Paper.pdf); explore future ethical challenges to the [Army Profession](http://cape.army.mil/); and discuss the concept and strategy for Character Development.\n  \nThe event is sponsored by the commanding general (CG), [U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/) (TRADOC). Invitees include senior Army leaders from all components.\n\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nThe CSA's intent in establishing this symposium is to generate shared understanding of the central role of the [Army Ethic](http://cape.army.mil/) in explaining, inspiring, and motivating why and how we serve.  As the Army moves further into the 21st century, the Army is in a period of strategic transition which presents tremendous opportunities for the profession. The Army should be the nation's leading institution for human capital and ethical development. To be that leader, the Army must intensify its understanding of what it means for the Army to be a Profession.  \n\n\n**What has the Army done?** \n\nIn October 2010, the [Secretary of the Army](http://www.army.mil/leaders/sa/) and the [CSA](http://www.army.mil/leaders/csa/) directed the CG, TRADOC to conduct a critical review to assess how protracted years of war affected members of the Army Profession. The findings and recommendations led to several initiatives (e.g., publication of [Army Doctrine Reference Publication (ADRP) 1: The Army Profession](http://armypubs.army.mil/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_a/pdf/adrp1.pdf). \n\nThe CSA also released the [Army Ethic White Paper](http://cape.army.mil/repository/white-papers/Army-Ethic-White-Paper.pdf) making the case for a concise, motivating, inspiring expression of the Army Ethic based on American values, laws, oaths, creeds, ethos, and our shared beliefs as Army Professionals. The CSA also approved the FY15-16 America's Army - Our Profession theme *Living the Army Ethic.*  \n\n\n**What efforts does the Army plan to continue in the future?**\n\nThis Army Profession Symposium for senior Army leaders will be followed by an Army Junior Leader Forum in the near future. The [Army Leader Development Program](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-04-15/) will be re-designated as the Army Profession and Leader Development Program in recognition of the essential integration of professional and leader development. The Army is writing a concise articulation of its ethic to be published in a revision of ADRP1 in 2015.\n\n\n**Resources:** \n\n* [Mission Command Center of Excellence]( http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/MCCOE/)\n* [Combined Arms Center](http://usacac.army.mil)\n* [Center for the Army Profession and Ethic](http://cape.army.mil)\n* [TRADOC](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/)\n* [Character Development](http://cape.army.mil/case-studies/vcs-single.php?id=8&title=character-development)\n* Related documents:\n* [- Army Ethic White Paper](http://cape.army.mil/repository/white-papers/Army-Ethic-White-Paper.pdf)\n* [- ADRP1: *The Army Profession*](http://armypubs.army.mil/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_a/pdf/adrp1.pdf)\n* Related STAND-TO!: \n* [- CSA's Strategic Priorities: Waypoint #2 ](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-02-24)\n* [- America's Army - Our Profession \"Stand Strong\"](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-12-16/)\n* [- America's Army - Our Profession](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/issue.php?issue=2013-01-17)\n* [- Army Leader Development Program](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-04-15/)\n* [- The Army Profession](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/issue.php?issue=2012-04-16)\n\n\n",
