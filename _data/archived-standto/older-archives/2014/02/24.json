    "body": "**What is it?** \n\nWaypoint #2 articulates Chief of Staff of the Army [Gen. Ray Odierno's vision](http://www.army.mil/leaders/csa) and strategic priorities for the U.S. Army in the years ahead.  The CSA's vision for the future is as follows: \n\n*The All-Volunteer Army will remain the most highly trained and professional land force in the world. It is uniquely organized with the capability and capacity to provide expeditionary, decisive landpower to the Joint Force and ready to perform across the range of military operations to Prevent, Shape, and Win in support of combatant commanders to defend the Nation and its interests at home and abroad, both today and against emerging threats.* \n\n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\n In January 2012, the CSA's [*Marching Orders*](http://www.army.mil/e2/c/downloads/234187.pdf) was published to outline his intent and priorities for sustaining a high-quality, all-volunteer Army and to describe his guiding principles and the fundamental characteristics of the future force. \n \nIn January 2013, as a follow up to the Marching Orders, [Waypoint #1](http://www.army.mil/e2/c/downloads/280914.pdf) was published, to highlight the Army's progress of Army initiatives, programs, and modernization efforts and to guide the efforts in 2013. \n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nTo accomplish the CSA's strategic imperative, [Way Point #2](http://www.army.mil/e2/c/downloads/332325.pdf) describes the five strategic priorities in [detail](http://www.army.mil/article/118873):  \n\n  * (1) Adaptive Army Leaders for a Complex World\n  * (2) A Globally Responsive and Regionally Engaged Army\n  * (3) A Scalable and Ready Modern Army\n  * (4) Soldiers Committed to Our Army Profession\n  * (5) The Premier All-Volunteer Army\n\n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nThe Army will focus on accomplishing the five strategic priorities which will help orient the force to take actions to suitably transition into an Army of the future.  \n\n \n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [Chief of Staff of the Army Gen.
