    "body": "**What is it?** \n  \nThe [U.S. Army World Class Athlete Program](http://www.thearmywcap.com) (WCAP) is a detachment of the U.S. Army Installation Management Command, Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation division. The program allows Soldiers - Active, Guard and Reserve -  an opportunity to train full time in an Olympic sport, and participate in the Pan American Games, World Championships,  Olympic and Paralympic games while maintaining a professional military career and promoting the U.S. Army to the world.\n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nThe Army has placed more than 600 Soldiers on the U. S. Olympic Team and has won more than 140 medals since 1948. One of the earliest Olympians was Lt. George S. Patton, who participated in the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, finishing fifth in the modern pentathlon (shooting, fencing, swimming, horseback riding and running).  There are currently more than a dozen Soldiers assigned to the program who have represented the Army and the United States at the Olympics and World Championships.  WCAP Soldiers represent the Army and the U.S. at the [2014 Olympic and Paralympic Games](http://www.army.mil/olympics/2014/) in Sochi, Russia.  \n\n**What continued efforts does the ARNG have planned for the future?**\n\nWCAP is also the lead agency for the Joint-Services Parathlete Program, offering wounded warriors an opportunity to train, compete and qualify for the Paralympic Games.  The program supports [resiliency](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient) by offering wounded warriors the means to pursue new goals and dreams, in spite of physical disabilities.  These athletes set examples for other wounded warriors and our nation with their amazing accomplishments. \n\nSoldier-athlete successes will be showcased on www.Army.mil as they compete at the Olympic and Paralympic games. \n \n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nWCAP Soldiers provide a positive impact on the Army's mission.  Olympic caliber athletes also assist instructors in the [Modern Army Combatives Program](http://www.benning.army.mil/infantry/197th/combatives/) and have trained hundreds of Soldiers to date.  They have provided thousands of potential leads to [Army recruiters](http://www.usarec.army.mil/) by sharing their Olympic story and promoting the Army in high schools and colleges during Total Army Involvement in Recruiting (TAIR) missions.  WCAP Soldiers have gone on to become recruiters, drill sergeants, Rangers and Special Forces.\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* Army.mil: [U.S. Army Olympians and Paralympian](http://www.army.mil/olympics/2014/)\n* Army.mil: [Sochi 2014: Olympian bios](http://www.army.mil/olympics/2014/olympians/index.html)\n* 2014 Olympic related stories on Army.mil: [U.S. Army Olympics news](http://www.army.mil/olympics/2014/news/army_news.html)\n* Team USA: [U.S. Paralympics](http://www2.teamusa.org/US-Paralympics.aspx)\n* [U.S. Army World Class Athlete Program](http://www.thearmywcap.com)\n* [U.S. Army MWR](http://www.armymwr.com/)\n* [U.S. Army Ready and Resilient](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient)\n* Social Media presence: \n * [WCAP on YouTube](www.youtube.com/TheArmyWCAP)\n * [WCAP on Twitter](www.twitter.com/ArmyWCAP)\n * [WCAP on Facebook](www.facebook.com/ArmyWCAP) \n * [WCAP on Flickr](www.flickr.com/photos/theArmyWCAP)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
