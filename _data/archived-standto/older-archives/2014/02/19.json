    "body": "**What is it?** \n\nThe Association of the United States Army's (AUSA) Institute of Land Warfare hosts an annual Winter Symposium and Exposition for members of the defense industry and the military community. The AUSA Winter Symposium provides a partner-focused platform to discuss the U.S. Army way-ahead with key Army, Department of Defense, foreign military and industry stakeholders.\n\nThe 2014 symposium will take place Feb. 19-21, at the Von Braun Center in Huntsville, Ala.  The symposium's theme is ***America's Army: Sustaining, Training, and Equipping for the Future***. The [U.S. Army Materiel Command](http://www.army.mil/info/organization/unitsandcommands/commandstructure/AMC/), headquartered at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, is the Army lead for this year's event.\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nThe Winter Symposium is the single most important platform for the Army to communicate to industry the Army's needs for current and future scenarios. A primary objective of the AUSA Winter Symposium is to provide an open forum for attendees to interact and participate in discussions on Industrial Partnering, Modernization, and Recruiting for the Force of the Future.  The event will focus on enabling technology for the Force 2025.  Professional forums enable direct dialogue between military leaders and symposium attendees, and reinforce Army priorities and strategic messages. \n\nPanel topics include *Industrial Operations, Modernization, Industrial Partnering, the Operational Environment in 2025, 2030 Requirements, and Operationalizing the Cyber Domain for the Army*.\n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nThis is the first time AUSA has held the Winter Symposium in Huntsville. Placing the 2014 event in direct proximity to AMC allows the Army to maximize military, civilian and industry attendance despite the constrained fiscal environment. Other commands and agencies at Redstone Arsenal include: [Army Aviation and Missile Command](http://www.army.mil/info/organization/unitsandcommands/commandstructure/AMCOM/),  [Army Security Assistance Command](http://www.army.mil/info/organization/usasac/), [Army Contracting Command](http://www.army.mil/info/organization/unitsandcommands/commandstructure/acc/), [Army Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Command]( http://www.amrdec.army.mil/amrdec/About/), [Army Space and Missile Defense Command](http://www.army.mil/info/organization/unitsandcommands/commandstructure/smdc/) and the [U.S. Missile Defense Agency](http://www.mda.mil/), among others. \n\nHuntsville serves as one of the United States' principal centers for space and defense technology. It is home to the second largest research park in the U.S. Nearly every major aerospace corporation is represented in the community, as well as numerous science and technology corporations.\n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nThe Army will continue to seek platforms like the Winter Symposium to engage key audiences, amplify key messages, and enhance opportunities for successful government/industry partnering.\n \n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [Winter Symposium and Exposition](http://ausameetings.org/winter/)\n* [Agenda](http://ausameetings.org/winter/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2014/02/winter-agenda-2-13-14.pdf)\n* [U.S. Army Materiel Command](http://www.army.mil/info/organization/unitsandcommands/commandstructure/AMC/)\n* [Army.mil: Professional Development Toolkit](http://www.army.mil/professional/)\n* Related: [2013 AUSA ILW Video Archive](http://www.army.mil/professional/ilw/?)\n ",
