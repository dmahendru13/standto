    "body": "**What is it?**\n\nIn October, the Army launched the Commander 360 (CDR360) program, a new assessment for battalion and brigade commanders in which they receive feedback from leaders, peers, and subordinates throughout their organization. It is a leader development program within the [Army's Multi-Source Assessment and Feedback (MSAF)](http://msaf.army.mil/LeadOn.aspx) suite of tools.\n\nDesigned specifically for Centralized Selection List (CSL) lieutenant colonels and colonels, the intent of CDR360 is to leverage 360-degree assessment feedback to enhance leadership growth and to increase rater involvement in the development process. Active and reserve component civilians and NCOs, as well as those from other services, may participate as assessors. The multi source feedback produces useful insights about the commander that the rater and commander are not likely to come by on their own. Only the commander and his or her current rater have access to the CDR360 report.\n\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nThe CDR 360 program promotes lifelong learning and is a key component in the Army's deliberate, continuous, and progressive process of leader development. It is another way to encourage greater leader-to-leader development across the Army by increasing rater involvement in multi-source assessments. The CDR360 program focuses on battalion- and brigade-level commanders because they represent a critical role as organizational leaders and key drivers of change for the Army.\n\n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nCDR360 was pilot tested from April to July 2013 and received favorable reviews from participating commanders and raters for its impact and utility for the commander's development. Raters who participated in the pilot said the instrument provided detailed assessment of commander's performance from otherwise uncertain perspectives, especially subordinates and peers.\n\nFollowing that successful pilot, the next phase in implementing the CDR360 was conducted in Spring and Summer 2014 with 24 active component commanders using the final version of the program.\n\n\n**What efforts does the Army plan to continue in the future?**\n\nEffective October 2014, approximately 1,200 CSL Lt. Col.- and Col.-level commanders in the active components are required to participate in two CDR360 events during the course of their command tenure the first within three to six months of assuming command and the second between 15-18 months of command. Each event includes a 360-degree assessment as well as a mandatory developmental discussion between the commander and his or her current rater.\n\nA similar phased fielding is planned for October 2015 for the nearly 2,400 Reserve component commanders.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [Mission Command Center of Excellence](http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/MCCOE/)\n* [Combined Arms Center](http://usacac.army.mil)\n* [Center for Army Leadership](http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/CAL/)\n* [TRADOC](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/)\n* [Center for the Army Profession and Ethic](http://cape.army.mil/news/commander-360-leader-development-program)\n* [Professional Development Toolkit](http://www.army.mil/professional)\n* Related Documents: \n* [- Army Regulation 350-1, Army Training and Leader Development](http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r350_1.pdf)\n* [- Army Doctrine Publication 6-0, Mission Command](http://armypubs.army.mil/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_a/pdf/adp6_0_new.pdf)\n* [- Army Doctrine Reference Publication 6-22, Army Leadership](http://armypubs.army.mil/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_a/pdf/adrp6_22_new.pdf)\n* Related Articles: \n* [- Army implements new self-awareness program for commanders](http://www.army.mil/article/134580/Army_implements_new_self_awareness_program_for_commanders/)\n* Related STAND-TO!\n* [- Army Leader Development Program](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-04-15/)\n* [- Army Leader Development Strategy 2013](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-06-19/)\n* [- Army Unit Training Management](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-03-07)\n* [- Basic Officer Leader Development Transformation](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-12-23/)\n* [- Army Training Network](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-07-22/)\n\n",

By encouraging input from peers, subordinates and superiors alike, leaders can better 'see themselves' and increase self-awareness. The ability to receive honest and candid feedback, in an anonymous manner, is a great opportunity to facilitate positive leadership growth.\n \n### - [Chief of Staff of the Army Gen.
