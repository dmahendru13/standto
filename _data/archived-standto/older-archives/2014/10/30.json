    "body": "**What is it?** \n\nThe 2014 Ebola epidemic is the largest in history, affecting [multiple countries](http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/2014-west-africa/distribution-map.html#areas) in West Africa. [U.S. Northern Command](http://www.northcom.mil/) (USNORTHCOM), as the Department of Defense lead for coordinating defense support of civil authorities in the United States, has been given the mission to stand up a joint medical support team (MST) to assist U.S. civilian hospitals to treat patients with Ebola and prevent the further spread of this epidemic. This is based off the [Oct. 19 request for assistance](http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=16986) from the [Department of Health and Human Services](http://www.hhs.gov/). \n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\n[U.S. Army North (Fifth Army)](http://www.arnorth.army.mil) (ARNORTH), USNORTHCOM's Army component, coordinated the training of the 30 person MST consisting of health care providers from across the nation representing the Army, Navy and Air Force. Training began at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, Oct. 22 and was completed Oct. 27.  \n\nThe multi-agency training effort included USARNORTH's Civil Support Training Activity (CSTA), the [U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease (USAMRIID)](http://www.usamriid.army.mil/) and [Naval Medical Research Directorate](http://www.med.navy.mil/sites/nmrc/Pages/id_main.htm) doctors selected for the MST. USAMRIID deployed instructors to train the team on donning and doffing personal protective equipment, a critical component of ensuring healthcare provider safety while treating Ebola patients. Additionally, eight CSTA subject matter experts evaluated the MST during their scenario-based certification exercise. [U.S. Army Medical Command](http://armymedicine.mil/pages/home.aspx), in conjunction with the USNORTHCOM surgeon, was instrumental in providing a training syllabus and coordination among other MEDCOM and joint agencies.  \n  \n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nNear term efforts will establish a world-class program of instruction for identified doctors, nurses, and trainers based on the standards and protocols as issued by the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](http://www.cdc.gov/), USAMRIID, and the [Defense Threat Reduction Agency](http://www.dtra.mil/). Upon certification, the MST may be employed to address multiple aspects of Ebola treatment such as facilitating additional training, serving as an interim staff while the existing staff is receiving additional/refresher training, augmenting a staff treating Ebola patients, and serving as a trained surge capability to deploy anywhere in the homeland. \n\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nThe Army's efforts to support its federal interagency and non-government partners are essential for unity of effort and maximizing response time in the nation's time of need. Development and training of the DOD MST supports this whole of government approach, which is vital for leveraging resources across the nation in preparing for, protecting against, responding to and recovering from all hazards and threats in the homeland. \n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [U.S. Army Public Health Command -- Ebola Virus Disease](http://phc.amedd.army.mil/topics/discond/diseases/pages/EbolaVirusDisease.aspx)\n* [Center for Disease Control and Prevention](http://www.cdc.gov/)\n* [U.S. Northern Command](http://www.northcom.mil/)\n* [U.S. Army North (Fifth Army)](http://www.arnorth.army.mil)\n* [Army.mil: Humanitarian Assistance](http://www.army.mil/humanitarian/)\n* Information and News on Ebola:\n* [- U.S. Army news, information about Army's response to Ebola threat](http://www.army.mil/article/136170/)\n* [- DOD helps fight Ebola in West Africa](http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2014/1014_ebola/)\n* [- Statement from Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby on Department of Defense Support to Department of Health and Human Services](http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=16986) \n* Related STAND-TO! \n* [- U.S. Army North Command Strategy](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-03-22/)\n* [- Civil Support Training Activity](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/issue.php?issue=2012-03-29)\n",
