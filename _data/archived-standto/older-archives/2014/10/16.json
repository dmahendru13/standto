    "body": "**What is it?**\n\nIndividual cybersecurity awareness focuses on the individual's understanding of their roles and responsibilities in reducing the occurrence of security incidents that undermine national security and degrade operational capabilities.\n\nIndividual awareness allows individuals to review their cybersecurity training, to educate themselves about cybersecurity and to become more aware of cybersecurity and the cyber threats facing the Army, themselves and their family and friends.\n\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?** \n\nCybersecurity is critical to all Army functions. Cyber attacks and user negligence threaten Army networks and information every day, putting Army operations and personnel at risk. Raising individual cybersecurity awareness and enforcing compliance helps improve the Army's cybersecurity posture and reduces the security risk to the Army. \n\n\n**What has the Army done?** \n \nIn May 2013, the Army published a ***[handbook](https://www.milsuite.mil/book/docs/DOC-73030)***  to provide leaders at all levels the information and tools needed to address cybersecurity challenges and to ensure that all organizations adopt the practices necessary to protect their information and the Army's network.\n\nThe Army also published the ***[Protect Operational Information Brochure](https://www.milsuite.mil/book/docs/DOC-159005)*** to educate all personnel about operations security and what they can do to reduce cyber risk.\n\nIn October 2013, the Army held an Information Assurance/Cybersecurity Awareness Week. This week provided an opportunity to heighten individual and collective knowledge about cybersecurity threats and individuals' roles and responsibilities in protecting the Army.\n\n\n**What does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nThe Army will continue this effort by holding an annual [Cybersecurity Awareness Month](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-10-01/).  To maintain access to Army information systems, the Army will continue to require personnel to annually complete their cybersecurity training. \n\n\n**Resources:** \n\n* CAC log-in required: [Army Information Assurance One-Stop Shop portal]( https://informationassurance.us.army.mil/) \n* [Office of the Army Chief Information Officer/G-6 ](http://ciog6.army.mil/)\n* [U.S. Army Cyber Command](http://www.arcyber.army.mil/index.html)\n* [DOD 2014 Cybersecurity Awareness Month Resources](http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2013/0713_cyberdomain/)\n* [The Department of Homeland Security's Stop.Think.Connect.

The potential for compromise of the network and the information it carries, and thereby harm to the Soldiers and leaders who rely on them, is simply enormous.\n\n\n### - Essye B.
