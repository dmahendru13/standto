    "body": "**What is it?** \n\nManaging and reducing energy consumption, employing renewable energy sources, and reducing and reusing water on U.S. Army installations are practices built upon the Army's long-standing energy efficiency and sustainability practices.\n \nThe [Army's Net Zero initiative](http://www.asaie.army.mil/Public/ES/netzero/index.html) is a strategy for managing water and energy. Net Zero is a force multiplier, aimed at bringing the overall consumption of resources (energy, water and solid waste) down to an effective rate of zero, where fiscally responsible, to provide greater energy and water security, as well as increase operating flexibility.\n\nManaging energy and water on Army installations effectively ensures that the Army has access to the energy and water it needs -- a fundamental enabler of the national security.\n\n\n**What is the Army doing?**\n\nTo emphasize the importance of energy and water management, the [Secretary of the Army Energy and Water Management Awards Program](http://army-energy.hqda.pentagon.mil/awards/sec_army.asp) recognizes installations, groups and individuals from the Army, Army Reserve and Army National Guard who make significant achievements in installation energy conservation and water management. \n\nThe annual awards enhance installation command emphasis, encourage good stewardship of energy and water resources, and reinforce the importance of meeting the Army's energy and water reduction goals. \n\n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nIncreasing installation resiliency is a challenge the Army continues to address through technologies, policies and programs. Since 2011, the Army's resiliency approach has been defined by the [Army's Net Zero initiative](http://www.asaie.army.mil/Public/ES/netzero/index.html), which enhances the Army's resiliency by improving energy and water security.\n\nThe Army will continue to foster collaboration and sharing best practices across installations, partner with private industry, local governments and communities and improve its operational resilience and energy security around the world.\n\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nEnergy supply shortfalls and power distribution failures, coupled with water scarcity, represent significant strategic vulnerabilities for the Army and the nation. As such, energy and water management practices underwrite the Army's ability to rapidly deploy, employ and sustain military forces around the globe.\n \nIn the last ten years, power interruptions on Army bases have more than quadrupled due to the impact of natural disasters and a vulnerable electrical distribution system. The cost of utilities on installations has also become a tremendous burden on the Army -- tripling in the last decade.\n\nThese challenges are fueled by population growth, rising oil prices and the effects of climate change -- increased water scarcity, unstable weather conditions, and disruptions and disasters growing in frequency, intensity and unpredictability.\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [Assistant Secretary of the Army (Installations, Energy and Environment)](http://www.asaie.army.mil/Public/ES/netzero/index.html)\n* [Army Energy News](http://www.army.mil/news/energy)\n* [Army Environmental News](http://www.army.mil/news/environment)\n* [Army Net Zero](http://www.asaie.army.mil/Public/ES/netzero/index.html)\n* [Secretary of the Army Energy and Water Management Awards Program](http://army-energy.hqda.pentagon.mil/awards/sec_army.asp)\n* Related STAND-TO: \n* [- Energy Action = Mission Success](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-10-07/)\n* [- Army Office of Energy Initiatives](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-10-14/)\n* [- Resilient Installations](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-10-17/)\n* [- Base Camp Integration Lab](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-10-24/)\n* [- Net Zero](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/2011/01/31/)\n\n",
