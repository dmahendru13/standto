    "body": "**What is it?**\n\nThe [Invictus Games](http://invictusgames.org/) is an international sports event for wounded, ill and injured service members and veterans. The event is championed by Prince Harry to use the power of sports to inspire recovery, support rehabilitation and generate a wider understanding and respect for those who serve their country. Prince Harry was inspired by his visit to the Warrior Games in Colorado last year and wanted to bring an international version of the event to the United Kingdom.\n\nMore than 400 wounded warrior athletes from 14 nations are participating in the 2014 Invictus Games in London, England, from September 10-14. Twenty-two wounded, ill and injured Soldiers and Army veterans are part of the 100-member [U.S. Team](http://wtc.army.mil/invictus_games/invictus_games_2014_athletes.html) that includes service members and veterans from Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force and Special Operations Command. \n\n[Invictus Games athletes](http://wtc.army.mil/invictus_games/invictus_games_2014_athletes.html) will compete in nine sports:  archery, indoor rowing, power lifting, road cycling, sitting volleyball, swimming, track and field, wheelchair basketball and wheelchair rugby. \n\nThe Invictus Games showcase the resilient spirit of today's wounded, ill and injured service members from all branches of the military across world. After overcoming significant physical and/or behavioral health injuries, these men and women demonstrate the power of ability over disability and the spirit of competition.\n  \n \n**What has the the Army done?**\n\nAt 26 Warrior Transition Units (WTUs) across the country, wounded, ill or injured Soldiers have one mission: to heal and prepare for transition. Adaptive reconditioning activities, including adaptive sports, are a valuable recovery tool incorporated into most WTU Soldiers' recovery plans across the [Warrior Care and Transition Program](http://www.wtc.army.mil/modules/soldier/s1-wctpProgram.html).\n\n\n**What efforts does the Army plan to continue in the future?**\n\nAdaptive sports and adaptive reconditioning activities are linked to a variety of benefits for wounded, ill and injured service members across all branches of the military: \n\n* -- less stress\n* -- reduced dependency on pain and depression medication\n* -- fewer secondary medical conditions (i.e. diabetes, hypertension)\n* -- higher achievement in education and employment\n* -- increased independence\n* -- increased self-confidence\n* -- increased mobility\n\nParticipation in sports and as part of a team also helps Soldiers adapt more easily and lessens behavioral health problems.\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nInvictus Games showcase the [resilience](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient), strength and abilities of the Army's wounded, ill or injured and highlights the Army's commitment to these Soldiers, veterans and their families. Invictus Games reinforce the commitment of the Army to care for all of its Soldiers -- wounded, ill or injured.\n\n\n\n**Resources:** \n\n* [Warrior Transition Command](http://wtc.army.mil/)\n* [- Warrior Care and Transition Program](http://www.wtc.army.mil/modules/soldier/s1-wctpProgram.html)\n* [- Invictus Games](http://wtc.army.mil/invictus_games/invictus_games_2014.html)\n* [- Meet your Athletes](http://wtc.army.mil/invictus_games/invictus_games_2014_athletes.html#MID)\n* [Army.mil: Ready and Resilient](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient)\n* [Army.mil: Soldier for Life](http://www.soldierforlife.army.mil/)\n* [Comprehensive Soldier and Family Fitness](http://csf2.army.mil/)\n* [Invictus Games Website](http://invictusgames.org/)\n* WTC on Social Media:\n* [- Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ArmyWTC)\n* [- Twitter](https://twitter.com/armywtc/)\n* [- Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/armywtc)\n* [- YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/WarriorCareCom)\n* Related articles:\n* [- World Class Athlete Program Soldier set for Invictus](http://www.army.mil/article/133309/)\n* [- Wounded, ill, injured Army athletes join U.S. team at inaugural Invictus Games in London](http://www.army.mil/article/133106/)\n* [- 'Unconquered' warriors in London for first Invictus Games](http://www.army.mil/article/133261/)\n\n\n\n",
