    "body": "**What is it?** \n\nEmergent Leader Immersive Training Environment (ELITE) is a state-of-the-art, training platform that uses a video program to train cadets, junior officers and non-commissioned officers on a range of counseling skills necessary to develop effective Army leaders. \n\nELITE provides junior leaders with an interactive, self-paced instructional experience followed by an opportunity to apply their counseling skills to five simulation practice exercises:\n\n* --A dispute between sergeants\n* --A Soldier with financial problems\n* --A Soldier arrested for driving under the influence \n* --A female Soldier asking for a transfer after hearing inappropriate comments   \n* --A fight between two Soldiers over comments, one them made about a female Soldier\n\nFor each scenario, ELITE provides users a menu of questions to ask an avatar representing the Soldier who needs counseling. The users' choices affect the video's storyline. At the end of the scenario, users receive an after-action review assessing their performance.  \n\n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nThe [Maneuver Center of Excellence](http://www.benning.army.mil/mcoe/), the Fires Center of Excellence and the [U.S. Military Academy](http://www.usma.edu/SitePages/Home.aspx) submitted a requirement for a serious game that would address soft leadership and counseling skills. The request resulted in a collaborative effort involving the: \n\n* --University of Southern California Institute for Creative Technologies\n* --Army Research Laboratory, Human Research & Engineering Directorate, Orlando, Florida \n* --Army Sexual Harassment/Assault Response Prevention (SHARP) Program Office \n* --Army Games for Training Program at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas \n\nIn August, the [Combined Arms Center -- Training](http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/cac-t/) at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, accredited ELITE. West Point cadets began using ELITE as part of a leadership course this fall.  ELITE is available for a free download at the [Milgaming web site](https://milgaming.army.mil/), which is a Common Access Card site.\n\n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nThe Army is working on another iteration of ELITE that will address SHARP issues for company-level officers and NCOs. \n\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nLeveraging the [Army Learning Model](http://www.army.mil/article/127316/), ELITE uses technology to help young leaders hone their counseling skills. Those skills are critical to help leaders reach their full potential and prepare units to accomplish any mission.\n\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [MilGaming portal](https://milgaming.army.mil/)\n* [USACE: National Simulation Center](http://usacac.army.mil/organizations/cact/nsc/tcm-virtual-gaming)\n* [Army Research Laboratory: Human Research and Engineering](http://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?page=31)\n* [Army.mil: Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention](http://www.army.mil/sharp)\n* Related article: \n* [- Avatar-based simulations to boost counseling skills](http://www.army.mil/article/133776/)\n* Related STAND-TO! \n* [- Virtual Battlespace 3](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-05-19/)\n* [- Sexual Harassment/Assault Prevention](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-06-07/)\n* [- The Army Learning Concept - 2015](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/2010/10/19/)\n\n",
