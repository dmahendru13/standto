    "body": "**What is it?**\n\nIn support of the nation's observance of Suicide Prevention Week, Sept. 8 -14, 2014, the U.S. Army amplifies its promotion the importance of resilience building and suicide awareness within the Army profession during the entire month of September.  This year's theme is *Enhancing Resiliency -- Strengthening Our Professionals*.  \n\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nThe Army continues to build upon the lessons learned and potential best practices from its ongoing [Ready and Resilient campaign](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient/) effort to reduce the incidence of suicide while building resilience, strengthening the Army professionals and sustaining readiness across the Total Army.  Leaders will continuously execute activities and events that build resiliency and promote education and awareness of prevention, intervention and training that support the [Army Total Force Policy](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/issue.php?issue=2012-10-23).  \n\n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nTo promote the [Army Suicide Prevention Program](http://www.preventsuicide.army.mil/) efforts, the [Deputy Chief of Staff, G-1](http://www.armyg1.army.mil/), Army Resiliency Directorate (ARD) published an [ALARACT, *Tri-Signed Letter*](http://www.armyg1.army.mil/hr/suicide/docs/SPM_Tri-Signed_Letter_2014.pdf), and a list of recommended activities for installations to engage in.  In collaboration with the [Defense Suicide Prevention Office](http://www.suicideoutreach.org/), ARD will sponsor the 2014 Resiliency Health Fair, Sept. 9, in the Pentagon Courtyard, which is open to all DOD service members, civilians and family members.  Communications efforts include: senior leader public service announcements, senior leader talking points, video testimonials, social media events, and internal/ external media stories.  The Army encourages leaders to conduct similar efforts and activities within their commands.\n\n**What efforts does the Army plan to continue in the future?**\n\nArmy senior leaders expect commanders to: \n\n* (1) Conduct and ensure annual suicide prevention training as required in [AR 350-1](http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r350_1.pdf)\n* (2) Continuously execute activities and events for Soldiers, Army civilians and family members that build resiliency and promote awareness of suicide prevention and intervention\n* (3) Challenge and empower all members of the Total Army to build resilience and then intervene and act when necessary to save lives, in order to strengthen the individual, their units and the Army.  \n\n\n\n\n**Resources:** \n\n* [U.S. Army's Ready and Resilient Campaign](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient/)\n* [Army Suicide Prevention Program](http://www.preventsuicide.army.mil/)\n* [Army G-1: Suicide Prevention Training Resources](http://www.armyg1.army.mil/hr/suicide/training.asp)\n* [Public Health Command](http://phc.amedd.army.mil/)\n* [Army Behavioral Health](http://armymedicine.mil/Pages/behavioralhealth.aspx)\n* [Defense Suicide Prevention Office](http://www.suicideoutreach.org/)\n* Related documents:\n* [- ALARACT, Tri-Signed Letter]( http://www.armyg1.army.mil/hr/suicide/docs/SPM_Tri-Signed_Letter_2014.pdf)\n* [- AR 350-1, *Army Training and Leader Development*](http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r350_1.pdf)\n* Related STAND-TO!\n* [-Ready and Resilient Campaign Update](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-07-15/)\n* [-Army Total Force Policy]( http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/issue.php?issue=2012-10-23)\n\n",
