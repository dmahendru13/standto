    "body": "*Thirteen years have passed since we endured the worst terrorist attack in our nation's history. And in that time, America has transcended the tragic images and fearful memories of that day. We have forged a new narrative of resolve and [resilience](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient). That recovery, in very large part, has been made possible thanks to the drive, determination and willing sacrifices of America's Soldiers, [civilians](http://cape.army.mil/civilians.php) and [families](http://www.army.mil/families).*\n\n*Like America itself, our Army's spirit and dedication have remained indomitable over these past 13 years of near-continuous war. The strength and integrity of our Soldiers, civilians and families are a powerful example of the values we hold and the virtues to which we aspire.*\n\n*On this observance of Patriot Day 2014, we ask that each of you continue to honor the legacy of the victims who lost their lives that day. We also ask that you continue in your unwavering support for our Soldiers, [veterans](http://www.army.mil/veterans), families and civilians who help keep America safe and secure.
