    "body": "**What is it?** \n\nThe [Warrior Games](http://www.wtc.army.mil/warrior_games/) showcase the resilient spirit of today's wounded, ill and  injured service members from all branches of the military. After overcoming significant physical and behavioral injuries, these men and women demonstrate the power of ability over disability and the spirit of competition.\n\nThe 2014 Warrior Games take place from Sept. 28 -- Oct. 4, in Colorado Springs, Colorado with teams from Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, Navy and Special Operations Command. The [Army is sending a team](http://www.wtc.army.mil/warrior_games/warrior_games_2014_athletes.html) of 40 Soldiers and veterans to compete and to highlight how the Army takes care of all its Soldiers -- wounded, ill or injured.\n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nAll 26 Warrior Transition Units (WTUs) across the country have one mission: to heal and prepare the wounded, ill or injured Soldiers for transition. Adaptive reconditioning activities-including adaptive sports-are a valuable recovery tool incorporated into most WTU Soldiers' recovery plans across the [Warrior Care and Transition Program](http://www.wtc.army.mil/modules/soldier/s1-wctpProgram.html).\n\nSince 2010, approximately 200 wounded, ill or injured service members and Veterans have competed annually at the Warrior Games, a unique partnership between the Department of Defense and [U.S. Olympic Committee Paralympic Military Program](http://www.teamusa.org/warriorgames/).\n\nAthletes compete in archery, cycling, shooting, swimming, sitting volleyball, track and field and wheelchair basketball. Just as other events sponsored by the U.S. Olympic Committee, gold, silver and bronze medals are awarded.\n\n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nThe [Warrior Transition Command](http://wtc.army.mil/)  will continue to provide adaptive sports and reconditioning for wounded, ill and injured service members across all branches of the military. Participation in sports and as part of a team helps Soldiers to a variety of benefits:\n\n* -- less stress\n* -- reduced dependency on pain and depression medication\n* -- fewer secondary medical conditions (i.e. diabetes, hypertension)\n* -- higher achievement in education and employment\n* -- increased independence\n* -- increased self-confidence\n* -- increased mobility\n* -- easy adaptability\n* -- less behavioral health problems\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nWarrior Games showcases the resilience, strength and abilities of the Army's wounded, ill or injured. These games highlight the Army's commitment to these Soldiers, veterans and their families. Warrior Games reinforce the commitment of the Army to care for all of its Soldiers -- wounded, ill or injured.\n\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [Warrior Transition Command](http://wtc.army.mil/)\n* [- Warrior Games](http://www.wtc.army.mil/warrior_games/)\n* [- Meet your Athletes](http://www.wtc.army.mil/warrior_games/warrior_games_2014_athletes.html) \n* [Army.mil: Ready and Resilient](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient)\n* [Army.mil: Soldier for Life](http://www.soldierforlife.army.mil/)\n* [Comprehensive Soldier and Family Fitness](http://csf2.army.mil/)\n* [Warrior Games Website](http://www.teamusa.org/warriorgames/)\n* WTC on Social Media:\n* [- Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ArmyWTC)\n* [- Twitter](https://twitter.com/armywtc/)\n* [- Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/armywtc)\n* [- YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/WarriorCareCom)\n* Related STAND-TO!: \n* [- 2014 Invictus Games](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-09-10/)\n",
