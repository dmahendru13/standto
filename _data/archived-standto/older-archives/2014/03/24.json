    "body": "**What is it?** \n\nThe U.S. Army utilizes the Department of Defense [Hero 2 Hired](http://www.H2H.jobs) (H2H) platform as its interim employment connection application/tool to provide one primary location where Soldiers of all components, veterans, and family members can connect with private industry employment opportunities.   \n\nThis web-based application enables Soldier to translate military occupational skills (MOS), provide career path exploration, upload resumes, allow customized job searches.  The site also enables employers to search for transitioning Soldiers and veterans, and provide performance metrics.\n\n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nThe Army has conducted multiple transition studies and determined there was a need to better prepare the Soldiers for post-military service, as well as to enhance opportunities to connect Soldiers with private industry.  The H2H employment application tool is just one product of this ongoing effort.  \n\nIn addition, the Army continues to support the White House Employment Initiative and the Department of Defense-[Department of Veterans Affairs](http://www.va.gov/) (DOD-VA) Veterans Employment Initiative Task Force (TF) in the development of a new transition training and services delivery model to maximize the career readiness of all service members.   \n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nThe Army will continue to engage community, non-profit and private industry partners as part of a comprehensive communications campaign to ensure employers recognize the value in hiring veterans and gain access to acquiring our transitioning talent. First and foremost, Soldiers bring the Army ethos to the civilian sector - unparalleled commitment to their mission, determination for success, and loyalty to their organization. In addition, the diverse skill sets of the thousands of Soldiers scheduled to transition over the next few years are a uniquely rich human capital resource for employers to tap into.\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nSoldiers, retirees, veterans  and families face a number of challenges transitioning from military to civilian life.  The Army has a responsibility to ensure transitioning personnel have the support they need and deserve prior to separating, and are career ready to enter the civilian workforce.  More than 130,000 Soldiers transitioned from the Army last year. It is very important for the Army to reintegrate the transitioning Soldiers  into communities, with full access to employment; education and healthcare, so as to inspire the next generation of Soldiers to serve, actively promote the benefits and sense of accomplishment that comes with serving in the U. S. Army. The Soldiers will sustain the Army's imperative of an *All-Volunteer Force* as a [Soldier for Life](http://www.army.mil/soldierforlife/). \n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n*  [Hero 2 Hired](http://www.H2H.jobs)\n*  [Army Career and Alumni Program](https://www.acap.army.mil/default.aspx)\n*  [My Army Benefits ](http://myarmybenefits.us.army.mil/)\n*  [Soldier for Life](http://www.army.mil/soldierforlife/)\n*  [U.S. Army Veterans](http://www.army.mil/veterans)\n*  [Ready and Resilient- Transition](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient/transition)\n*  [Army G-1](http://www.armyg1.army.mil/)  \n*  Related STAND-TO!:\n *  [- Soldier for Life](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-01-17/)\n *  [- Army Career and Alumni Program](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-07-26/)\n *  [- Veterans Opportunity to Work (VOW) to Hire Heroes Act](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/issue.php?issue=2012-12-10)\n *  [- Army Transition Policy Initiative](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/issue.php?issue=2011-12-07)",
