    "body": "**What is it?** \n\nIn partnership with Cameroon and the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) and the Military Forces of Central Africa (FOMAC),  [U.S. Army Africa](http://www.usaraf.army.mil/), will conduct Exercise Central Accord 14 in Douala and Koutaba, Cameroon, to increase the capacity of FOMAC to provide mission command capability to support regional peace operations. Approximately 1,200 military personnel from FOMAC and the United States, along with observers from several neighboring countries, will participate in the exercise. \n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nU.S. engagement with countries in Africa is not new. For the past few decades, America has partnered with African militaries in mission command capacity-building events, various training engagements, and across a number of key skill sets. Central Accord 14 is a two-part exercise:  \n  \n* -Part I:  Participants receive academics focused on collective tasks, functional, and staff procedures in support of command and control of a peacekeeping operation based on real world events. \n* -Part II: In a field training exercise, a brigade headquarters staff will prepare and then execute its plan to move forces into a contested area, defeat opposition forces, and restore basic services and the rule of law while setting the stage for national reconciliation.\n\n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nU.S. Army Africa is committed to partnering with African countries to showcase military interoperability. This dynamic process and the further development of relationships build capacity and strengthen military-to-military (M2M) relationships and regional security in Central Africa. This exercise is an example of U.S. Army Africa's commitment to strengthening its relationships with partner nations in Africa.  Future Central Accords are scheduled to take place in Gabon. USARAF will continue the relationships created during the exercise and will continue to build upon the partnerships established here. \n \n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nThe benefit of exercises like this is increased capacity and mutual respect gained by professional militaries working side-by-side. This exercise is a key element in a broader series of military-to-military activities to demonstrate the strong partnership between the U.S. and FOMAC, as well as all of the participating militaries. CA 14 brings together Cameroon, FOMAC, and the U.S. to foster security cooperation while improving medical and logistics capability in the central region.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [U.S. Army Africa](http://www.usaraf.army.mil/) \n* [U.S. Africa Command](http://www.africom.mil/) \n* Related STAND-TO!: \n * [- Regionally Aligned Force Training Environment-Africa](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-08-06/)\n * [- Regionally Aligned Forces](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/issue.php?issue=2012-12-20)\n* U.S. Army Africa's social media presence: \n  * [- Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ArmyAfrica)\n  * [- Twitter](https://twitter.com/usarmyafrica) \n  \n  ",
