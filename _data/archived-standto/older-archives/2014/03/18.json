    "body": "**What is it?** \n\nPresident Barack Obama will award the nation's highest award for valor to 24 United States Army veterans today.  The [Valor 24 Medal of Honor](http://www.army.mil/medalofhonor/valor24/index.html?from=st) awards ceremony is the largest one conducted since World War II.  \n\nSeven Medal of Honor (MOH) awards are being given to World War II veterans, nine to Korean War veterans, and eight to Vietnam War veterans. All awards are posthumous with the exception of three living Vietnam veterans, [Master Sgt. Jose Rodela](http://www.army.mil/medalofhonor/valor24/recipients/rodela?from=st), [Sgt. 1st Class Melvin Morris](http://www.army.mil/medalofhonor/valor24/recipients/morris?from=st), [Sgt. Santiago J. Erevia](http://www.army.mil/medalofhonor/valor24/recipients/erevia?from=st). \n\nWhile the living recipients will receive the medal in person at the White House ceremony,   the awards for the 21 posthumous recipients will be presented to the recipients' families. \n\n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nAll [24 Soldiers](http://www.army.mil/medalofhonor/valor24/recipients/index.html?from=st), receiving the Medal of Honor, were previously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC), the nation's second highest award. This award is an upgrade of their DSC.\n\nTo honor these remarkable veterans, the Army created the  [*Valor24* microsite](http://www.army.mil/medalofhonor/valor24?from=st), where viewers can access [biographies](http://www.army.mil/medalofhonor/valor24/recipients/index.html?), citations, and interviews about the recipients' heroism above and beyond the call of duty.  In addition, the Army published exclusive *#Valor24* content for each recipient on the [Army Live](http://armylive.dodlive.mil/) blog and the [Army's official Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/USarmy) page. \n \n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nA congressional review and the 2002 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) prompted a review of Jewish American and Hispanic American veteran war records from WWII, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. During the review, records of several Soldiers of neither Jewish nor Hispanic descent were found to display criteria worthy of the Medal of Honor. The 2002 NDAA was amended to recognize these Soldiers with the upgrade - in addition to the Jewish and Hispanic American Soldiers.  \n\nThe U.S. Army is proud of these Soldiers and glad to see their professionalism, service and sacrifice being recognized again - in full view of a new generation. This unique ceremony highlights the total Army's diversity and strength. \n  \n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nIn addition to today's ceremony at the White House, Army senior leaders will recognize the 24 recipients during a Pentagon ceremony scheduled for Wednesday, March 19.   \n\n**Resources:**\n\n*  [Live Stream @ 3:25 p.m.](http://www.army.mil/medalofhonor/valor24/?from=st)\n*  [Medal of Honor: Valor 24](http://www.army.mil/medalofhonor/valor24?from=st)\n*  [U.S. Army's Medal of Honor website](http://www.army.mil/medalofhonor/)\n*  [Congressional Medal of Honor Society](http://www.cmohs.org/)\n*  [Army Values](http://www.army.mil/values/)\n*  Related STAND-TO!: \n *  [- Soldier for Life](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/issue.php?issue=2012-11-13)\n* Related articles:\n *  [- Master Sgt.
