    "body": "**What is it?**\n\nThe Brain Health Consortium brings together military, academia and researchers in neurology, neuroscience, psychiatry and psychology, and other clinical and public health experts for challenging, spirited discussions on ways to improve Brain Health for Soldiers and the Army family. \n\nLt. Gen. Patricia Horoho, the Army Surgeon General and commanding general, HQ, [U.S. Army Medical Command](http://armymedicine.mil/pages/home.aspx), will host the inaugural [Brain Health Consortium](http://armymedicine.mil/pages/Brain_Health_Consortium.aspx), 10-11 April 2014, at Defense Health Headquarters, Falls Church, Va. \n\nThe theme for the two-day event is *Brain Health:  Partnering to Explore the New Frontier.*  Topics and panel discussions the consortium will explore include:  [Performance Triad](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-03-12/) ([Sleep](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-02-13/), [Activity](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-02-27/) and [Nutrition](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-01-31/)) and Brain Health, Readiness and Resiliency,  Cognitive Performance,  Neuroplasticity, Mindfulness Training,  the Human Dimension Program and more.\n\n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nArmy Medicine is transforming from a provider of healthcare services to an integrated system for health. The Army is working outside of the brick and mortar facilities to engage all sectors of the community to build health into every aspect of the Soldier's lives. \n\n  \n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nHealth is more than simply the absence of disease or injury. It's a state of complete social, mental, spiritual and physical well-being. Brain plasticity is the brain's unique ability to constantly change, grow and remap itself over the course of a lifetime.  The April Brain Health Consortium is the Army's first step towards building enduring partnerships with academia, industry and other experts to foster continued understanding of brain health.   \n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nThe brain is the most important part of the human body. The Brain Health Consortium helps the Army to initiate national dialogue to optimize health for the entire Army family. Outcomes of the April Brain Health Consortium will help shape the future direction of Brain Health for the Army, and be leveraged to strengthen the [readiness and resilience](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient/) of the Soldiers, families, and retirees.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [Brain Health Consortium](http://armymedicine.mil/pages/Brain_Health_Consortium.aspx)\n* [Performance Triad](http://armymedicine.mil/Pages/performance-triad.aspx)\n* [Army Family Performance Triad Campaign Toolkit](http://armymedicine.mil/Pages/Army_Family_Performance_Triad.aspx)\n* [Ready and Resilient- Medical Readiness](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient/medical)\n* [Army TBI](http://www.army.mil/tbi)\n* [Comprehensive Soldier & Family Fitness (CSF2) Program](http://csf2.army.mil/) \n* [CDC Healthy Brain Initiative](http://www.cdc.gov/aging/healthybrain/index.htm)\n* [Defense Centers of Excellence](http://dcoe.mil/About_DCoE.aspx) \n* [Health.mil: Operation Live Well ](http://www.health.mil/livewell)\n* Related article:  \n* [- Healing the injured brain: VA, DoD join forces on research to combat TBI, PTSD](http://home.fhpr.osd.mil/press-newsroom/fhpr-news/current_news/12-02-10/Healing_the_injured_brain_VA_DoD_join_forces_on_research_to_combat_TBI_PTSD.aspx)\n* Related STAND-TO!: \n* [- Performance Triad](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-03-12/) \n* [- Sleep](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-02-13/)\n* [- Activity](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-02-27/)\n* [- Nutrition](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-01-31/)\n* [- Traumatic Brain Injury](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/issue.php?issue=2012-06-27)\n",
