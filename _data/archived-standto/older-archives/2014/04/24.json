    "body": "**What is it?**\n\nThe U.S. Army partners with the [U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration](http://www.justice.gov/dea/index.shtml) (DEA) to support *National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day*, which offers an opportunity to safely dispose of unused, unwanted and expired prescription drugs. \n\n\n**What is the Army doing?**\n\nOn April 26, 2014, venues will be open on Army installations throughout the continental United States Alaska and Hawaii for members of the Army community to deposit potentially dangerous prescription drugs, particularly controlled substances, from their medicine cabinets. \n\n[U.S. Army Installation Management Command](http://www.imcom.army.mil/) garrisons, in collaboration with the [U.S. Army Medical Command](http://www.armymedicine.army.mil/), will support this effort, and will coordinate with local law enforcement officials to provide collection points with high visibility to the military community. The garrison [Army Substance Abuse Program](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-07-31/) (ASAP) office serves as the local point of contact. \n\nInstallation Provost Marshal Offices, or Directorates of Emergency Services, will provide security at the [drop-off locations](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/NTBI/NTBI-PUB.pub?_flowExecutionKey=_cAECA2BFE-7491-04AA-F58F-CFD604E8E037_k0E5CF6F0-D606-F2D7-B08F-E668B9484B6D), as only law enforcement officials can legally collect unwanted prescription drugs at these events. The collection points will be in areas of high visibility to the military community. \n\n**Why is this important to the Army?** \n\nMany medications, particularly prescription painkillers, sit unused and unsecured in medicine cabinets, making them readily available.\n\nThe Army is committed to supporting raising public awareness of Department of Defense's efforts to foster safe and drug-free military communities. The Army's previous efforts contributed to the overall DEA National Prescription Take-Back Day program.\n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nThe Army is committed to supporting raising public awareness of Department of Defense's efforts to foster safe and drug-free military communities. The Army's previous efforts contributed to the overall DEA National Prescription Take-Back Day program.\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [U.S. Army Installation Management Command](http://www.imcom.army.mil/)\n* [U.S. Army Medical Command](http://www.armymedicine.army.mil/) \n* [Army.mil: Health News](http://www.army.mil/news/health/)\n* [U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)](http://www.justice.gov/dea/index.shtml)\n* [DEA's Office of Diversion Control](http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug_disposal/takeback/index.html)\n* [DEA:  Drug Disposal Information](http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug_disposal/takeback/)\n* Related STAND-TO!:\n* [- Army Substance Abuse Program](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-07-31/)\n\n\n\n",
