    "body": "**What is it?**\n\nThe Post Deployment Health Reassessment (*DD Form 2900*), commonly known as the PDHRA is the third and final deployment health assessment administered to Soldiers and [Department of the Army (DA) Civilians](http://www.armyg1.army.mil/civilians.asp) during the deployment cycle.  \n\nThe PDHRA addresses physical, mental and behavioral concerns 90-180 days after redeployment.  Once a Soldier completes the [*DD Form 2900*](http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/infomgt/forms/eforms/dd2900.pdf),  the unit schedules a one-on-one  appointment with a health care provider to discuss their responses in a confidential and private setting.  During the confidential conversation, the Soldier is given the opportunity to discuss any concerns and may be referred to specialty care, treatment or rehabilitation services to treat any identified health threats and/or injuries.  \n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nSince 2006, over 1.2 million Soldiers and DA Civilians have taken the PDHRA to overcome deployment related physical injuries and behavioral health conditions such as [post traumatic stress disorder](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-08-27/) (PTSD), depression, [traumatic brain injury](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/issue.php?issue=2012-06-27) (TBI) and [substance abuse](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-07-31/).  \n\nThe PDHRA is a critical tool for commanders to increase unit readiness in support of continental United States/ outside the continental United States (CONUS/OCONUS) deployments, to include humanitarian missions, training events and operational deployments.    \n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\n* (1)  The PDHRA connects Soldiers with medical care and services to address deployment-related health conditions that may have evolved since redeployment. \n* (2) Commanders rely on the PDHRA as a health prevention tool -  a way to mitigate health threats and more importantly, promote Soldier resilience and provide his/her Soldiers the medical care they need to be healthy and mission ready.  \n* (3) The PDHRA, along with the [Pre-Deployment Health Assessment](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-02-14/) (Pre-DHA) and [Post-Deployment Health](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-03-20/)  (PDHA), is uniquely tailored to address health issues that develop during a critical period after deployment.    \n* (4) [Deployment Health Assessments](http://www.armyg1.army.mil/hr/dhap/index.html), along with periodic mental health assessments, are critical tools in support of the Army's [Ready and Resilient initiative](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient/).\n\n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nIn a collaborative effort between the [Deployment Health Assessment Program](http://www.armyg1.army.mil/hr/dhap/index.html), [Comprehensive Soldier & Family Fitness (CSF2) Program](http://csf2.army.mil/), and the [U.S. Army Walter Reed Army Institute of Research)](http://wrair-www.army.mil/) (WRAIR), the Army is promoting the importance of taking Deployment Cycle [Resilience Training ](https://www.resilience.army.mil/) (DCRT), a tailored resilience training series that promotes life, performance and psychological skills for Soldiers, commanders and unit staff going through the deployment cycle.  \n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [Army.mil: Ready and Resilient](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient) \n* [Deployment Health Assessment Program](http://www.armyg1.army.mil/hr/dhap/index.html)\n* [DHAP (Army Reserve)](http://dhap.reserve.army.mil/)\n* [DHAP (Army National Guard)](http://dhap.guard.army.mil/) \n* [Comprehensive Soldier & Family Fitness (CSF2) Program](http://csf2.army.mil/) \n* [U.S. Army Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR)](http://wrair-www.army.mil/)\n* Related STAND-TO!: \n* [- Ready and Resilient: Post-Deployment Health Assessment](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-03-20/)\n* [- Ready and Resilient: Pre-Deployment Health Assessment](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-02-14/)\n* [- Ready and Resilient Campaign: Deployment Health Assessments](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-07-12/)\n* [- Deployment Health Assessments for Soldiers and Civilians](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/issue.php?issue=2013-01-03)\n* [- Army Deployment Health Assessments](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/issue.php?issue=2012-03-20)\n* Related video: [Army Deployment Health Assessments](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0Lybjm_AoI)\n* Related articles:  \n* [- Deployment Health Assessment Program builds ready, resilient Soldiers](http://www.army.mil/article/105757/)\n* [- States focus on deployment health to improve readiness and resilience](http://www.army.mil/article/114844/)\n* [- Medical leaders meet, discuss health of Reserve force](http://www.army.mil/article/111657/)\n* Documents:\n* [- DD Form 2900](http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/infomgt/forms/eforms/dd2900.pdf)\n* [- DD Form 2795: *Pre-Deployment Health Assessment*](http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/infomgt/forms/forminfo/forminfopage2346.html)\n* [- Army Regulation 600-8-10 01: *Personnel Processing (In-, Out-, Soldier Readiness, Mobilization, and Deployment Processing*) ](http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r600_8_101.pdf)\n\n",

Ray Odierno,  while highlighting the long-term effect of war on behavioral health issues, also emphasized that \"good progress\" has taken place in the Army's behavioral health assessment since the last five years, responding to questions regarding the  April 2 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas, at the Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing last week. \n\n###  [SecArmy: Tracking 'insider threats' challenging](http://www.army.mil/article/123366/)\n\n### STAND-TO!: [Senior Leader Messages Regarding Fort Hood Incident](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-04-04)",
