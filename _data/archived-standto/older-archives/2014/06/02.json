The annual event is endorsed and recognized as an official Army observance by senior Army leadership.\n\n**What is the Army doing?**\n  \nThe [U.S. Army Combat Readiness/Safety Center](https://safety.army.mil) launches an Army-wide campaign each June 1 to mark National Safety Month. Media products supporting the month, including feature articles, posters and informational videos, are made available on the USACRC/Safety Center [home page](https://safety.army.mil). Materials typically focus on different aspects of safety in the Army, including civilian injury prevention, ground operations, aviation operations and driving. All products are available for electronic download by individual users, who may then reproduce or broadcast the information as required to meet their unit's needs.\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nThe spring and summer months are among the most dangerous times of year for Soldiers off duty, especially regarding accidents involving private motor vehicles, motorcycles and personal watercraft. Every day is critical when it comes to risk, and leaders, Soldiers, family members and Army civilians must work together to prevent needless losses within their formations. By using National Safety Month as a starting point for dialogue, leaders can establish or enhance safety programs that pay dividends throughout the year, regardless of season.\n\n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nThe Army will continue its annual observance of National Safety Month, with the USACRC/Safety Center providing supporting products and tools for users in the field. While yearly campaigns may differ in topic areas or focus, materials will always be developed according to the Army's latest accident trends and risk mitigation initiatives.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [USACRC/Safety Center](https://safety.army.mil)\n* Related STAND-TO!: \n* [- Off Duty Safety Awareness Presentation](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-05-20/)\n* [- Army Safety Online Tools and Initiatives](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-05-16/)\n \n\n",

Soldiers are out here getting to work in a multi-national environment and they are solving problems with their partners. When Soldiers exchange coffee or when Soldiers exchange cigarettes, they immediately begin to break down barriers and start to realize that we are all the same and we all have something to offer in this environment.\n\n### -  Col. John G. Norris, commander, [Joint Multinational Readiness Center](http://www.eur.army.mil/jmrc/), emphasizes the importance of multinational exercises, such as [Combined Resolve II](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-05-28/?s_cid=standto), which helps Soldiers to cross the language barrier by learning to communicate with other Soldiers  \n\n### [Combined Resolve II roles prepare European armies for coalition missions](http://www.army.mil/article/126931/)\n  \n",
