    "body": "**What is it?**\n\nThe [Warrior Leader Course](http://www.goarmy.com/soldier-life/being-a-soldier/ongoing-training/leadership-training/warrior-leader-course.html), or WLC, is the first leadership course non-commissioned officers (NCOs) attend as part of the NCO Education System. WLC provides the opportunity for specialists, corporals and newly-promoted sergeants to acquire the leader skills, knowledge and experience needed to lead a team-level-sized unit. WLC is a course that provides basic leadership training and is the foundation for further training and development. In 2009, [U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/) (TRADOC) began conducting WLC Mobile Training Teams, or MTTs, at Camp Buehring, Kuwait.\n\n**What has the Army done?** \n\nAfter nearly a decade of war and a rise in WLC backlog, due to Soldiers being deployed and unable to attend the course, TRADOC decided to bring WLC to the Soldiers in theater. The WLC MTT originally trained Soldiers assigned to Kuwait and Iraq. The WLC MTTs conducted in 2009 and 2010 at Camp Buehring served as the proof of principle that leadership training can be conducted in an operational area without disrupting the mission. \n\nBy bringing a WLC MTT to the warfighter, the Army decreased the backlog of Soldiers requiring WLC and provided crucial training to future NCOs. The MTTs consist of trained commandants, staff and instructors from NCO academies and regional training institutes across the Army who go on temporary duty assignments to instruct the training. MTT personnel and students represent all components of the Army -- active, Guard and Reserve -- making this a true total force MTT. The WLC MTT conducts the same training that would be conducted at an NCOA or RTI using the 169-academic-hours program of instruction. To date, about 3,700 Soldiers have graduated from the WLC Kuwait MTT. \n\n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nTRADOC continues to extend training to deployed Soldiers with the WLC MTT in Kuwait. This initiative brings crucial leader development training to deployed Soldiers.\n\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nBy continuing to request and resource the WLC MTT, the Army will not only ensure it has school-trained NCOs, but will also reduce the backlog of Soldiers needing to attend WLC.   \n\n\n**Resources:** \n\n* [- AR 350-1](http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r350_1.pdf)\n* Related Links:\n* [- WLC MTT Kuwait YouTube]( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8496D48E4867510D)\n",
