    "body": "**What is it?**\n\nThe U.S. Army's [Warrior Care Month](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-10-28/?) commemoration continues throughout November, and this week's theme is \"Show Your Strength through Reconditioning.\"  [Adaptive reconditioning](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-11-27/) includes activities and sports for wounded, ill and injured Soldiers to optimize their physical, cognitive and emotional well-being.  \n\n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nThe Army incorporated formal adaptive reconditioning programs at its 25 [Warrior Transition Units](http://www.wtc.army.mil/wtc/locations.html) (WTUs), and medical providers actively work to incorporate adaptive reconditioning into each Soldier's recovery plan.  Adaptive sports and reconditioning lead to a variety of benefits, including: less stress, fewer secondary medical conditions, increased independence, building relationships with others and learning new life skills to assist with transition.  \n\nWhether a wounded Soldier want to compete in the Warrior Games, hone their typing skills after an injury or work toward a new military occupational specialty (MOS), there is an adaptive reconditioning activity. Adaptive activities include: physical training, competitive and non competitive adaptive sports, therapeutic recreational activities, gym-based exercise programs, arts and cultural programs, lifestyle skills and outdoor activities. \n\n\n**What does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nAcross the Army, during November, Army WTUs will host adaptive sports and reconditioning events to educate Soldiers, veterans, families and communities at every level on the value and benefit of adaptive reconditioning.  WTU Soldiers will also take an active look at their adaptive reconditioning activities and goals to ensure they incorporate meaningful activities into their recovery and transition plans. \n\nSeveral events will occur around the country in the Army communities. The [Warrior Transition Command](http://www.wtc.army.mil/) will host a Joint-Service Sitting Volleyball Tournament and Expo in the Pentagon on Nov. 20.\n\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nWounded, ill and injured Soldiers contribute to the force in a variety of ways, including demonstrating the true spirit of resilience and the Warrior Ethos.  Since 2007, more than 62,000 Soldiers have recovered at WTUs, with nearly 50 percent returning to the force.  Adaptive reconditioning actively contributed to their readiness and to the overall readiness of the Army.\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [WTC Adaptive Reconditioning Webpage](http://www.wtc.army.mil/modules/soldier/s5-adaptiveReconditioning.html)\n* [Warrior Care Month Army Webpage](http://www.wtc.army.mil/wtc/warrior_care_month_2014.html)\n* [Warrior Care Month DOD Webpage](http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2014/1014_warriorcare/)\n* Related STAND-TO!:\n* [- Warrior Care Month](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-10-28/)\n* [- Warrior Care Month: Show Your Strength through Recovery](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-11-04/)\n\n",
