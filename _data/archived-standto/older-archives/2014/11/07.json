    "body": "**What is it?**\n\nExercise Combined Resolve III is a U.S. Army Europe-directed, Joint Multinational Training Command-led exercise taking place at Germany's Grafenwoehr and Hohenfels Training Areas, involving more than 4,000 soldiers from 19 NATO and European partner nations.  The exercise is designed to train the Army's current regionally aligned force supporting U.S. European Command -- the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division -- to operate within a coalition structure alongside our NATO allies.\n\nThe maneuver training portion of Combined Resolve III will feature a mix of multinational armor, mechanized and light infantry conducting unified land operations within the Army's Decisive Action Training Environment scenario.  A multinational opposing force from the Hohenfels-based U.S. Army's 1st Battalion, 4th Infantry Regiment and units from Canada, the Netherlands, Norway and the Louisiana Army National Guard will enhance the complex operating environment. \n\n\n**What is the Army doing?**\n\nCombined Resolve III is part of the second major rotation to Europe by the Fort Hood-based 1/1st, and a keystone in building the RAF for the Army.  The brigade is also currently providing the main U.S. force to Operation Atlantic Resolve in Europe.  To support those missions, the Army has pre-positioned the European Activity Set at Grafenwoehr, a state-of-the-art set of armored vehicles and equipment capable of outfitting a brigade combat team headquarters and battalion-sized task force with enablers.  The Army has also shipped additional armored vehicles and equipment from Fort Hood to supplement the increased size of the rotational force this fall.\n\n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nFuture Army rotational training events in Europe will take advantage of the Joint Multinational Training Command's unified live-fire, maneuver, simulation and classroom resources and infrastructure, at established training areas in Germany and emerging training areas in Eastern Europe.  To multiply these efforts, JMTC is developing a Connected Training Initiative (CTI) that supports NATO's Connected Forces Initiative. The CTI will digitally connect NATO and member nation simulation centers across Europe with JMTC and the U.S. in an effective, cost-efficient system that allows the Army to conduct large-scale mission command exercises with members of the alliance and other multinational partners.   \n\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nAs the featured training event for rotational forces in Europe, the Combined Resolve series of exercises provides an opportunity for U.S.-based Army forces to train alongside NATO allies and partners across Europe. These exercises establish tactical, technical, personal and professional connections that develop the Army's expeditionary and coalition-building capacities as they reassure European allies, increase NATO readiness and interoperability and maintain collective security in the region. \n\n\n**Resources**\n\n* [Combined Resolve III](http://www.eur.army.mil/jmtc/CombinedResolveIII.html)\n* [Joint Multinational Training Command](http://www.eur.army.mil/jmtc)\n* [1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division](http://www.hood.army.mil/1stcavdiv/pages/units/1bct/default.aspx)\n* [U.S. Army Europe](http://www.eur.army.mil/)\n* [Operation Atlantic Resolve](http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2014/0514_atlanticresolve/)\n* Related STAND-TO!: \n* [- USAREUR's Persistent Presence](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-05-07)\n* [- The European Activity Set](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-01-27/)\n* [- Regionally Aligned Forces](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/issue.php?issue=2012-12-20)\n* Related article: \n* [-Regionally aligned forces in Europe on display during CSA visit to Combined Resolve III](http://www.army.mil/article/137562/Regionally_aligned_forces_in_Europe_on_display_during_CSA_visit_to_Combined_Resolve_III/)\n",
