    "body": "**What is it?**\n\n[Vets4Warriors](http://www.vets4warriors.com/) provides free, confidential 24/7 peer-to-peer support to active duty, National Guard and reserve service members, transitioning retirees, and military families worldwide regardless of service affiliation. Vets4Warriors' peer support specialists are veterans who have been there and understand the problems unique to military life and know the challenges Soldiers face. Vets4Warriors will collaborate with the caller to set a plan to achieve goals, manage stress and build resilience. Vets4Warriors is available by phone, chat, and email, at 855-838-8255 (toll free) or vets4warriors.com. Service members or family members calling from outside the continental U.S. (OCONUS) should call a DSN operator at 312-560-1110.  If someone doesn't feel comfortable talking on the phone they can also chat online or via Facebook.    \n \nVets4Warriors is staffed by over 35 Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF), veterans from other combat eras, and spouses.  \n\nVets4Warriors is 100 percent confidential, meaning they will never share information with any other entity. Callers can even remain anonymous to the peer support specialist if they choose. \n  \nService members or family members will also receive ongoing support. Peer-to-peer support specialist will continue to follow-up until the problem is resolved even if that takes weeks or months.  \n\n\n**What has the ARNG done?**\n\nVets4Warriors originated as an Army National Guard initiative in 2010. Due to its overwhelming success, it has grown into an organization that provides peer-to-peer support to every service and family member regardless of their service affiliation. \n\nAs of Oct. 31, 2014 the call center has received more than 54,194 calls and has initiated more than 49,726 outreach calls since the program inception in 2011.\n\n\n**What continued efforts does ARNG have planned in the future?**\n\nVets4Warriors links to a multitude of resources. They are there to support the Soldier and his family, providing follow-up service where required. Vets4Warriors will have the capability to allow service or family members to receive assistance via text message or skype in the near future.  \n\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nMany components and members of the DOD are geographically dispersed, including Cadet Commands, Army Materiel Command, Recruiting Commands, deployed service members, the National Guard and the Army Reserves. This population in particular can benefit from the peer-to-peer support that Vets4Warriors provides.   \n\n\nThis resource is important to the DOD and specifically geographically dispersed service members because it increases the readiness, coping skills, and resilience of all of service members through peer-to-peer counseling, referrals, resilience case management, and outreach support services.  \n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [Vets4Warriors](http://www.vets4warriors.com/) \n* Contact Vets4Warriors: 1-855-838-8255\n* [Army National Guard](http://www.arng.army.mil/Pages/Default.aspx) \n* [Vets4Warriors on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/vets4warriors)\n* [Warrior Care Blog](http://warriorcare.dodlive.mil/2014/03/28/vets4warriors-call-center-available-247-to-you-and-your-family/)\n* [Defense Suicide Prevention Office]( http://www.suicideoutreach.org/Resources/vets4warriors.htm)\n* [Army Ready and Resilient](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient/resources)\n* Related article:\n* [- Rutgers University-based Military Support Program Expands](http://www.army.mil/article/127573/)\n",

There is still much work to do, but steady progress is being made against ISIL [Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]. As I've stated before, the fight against ISIL is a long-term one that will require a strong international coalition. \n\n### -  [Chief of Staff of the Army Gen.
