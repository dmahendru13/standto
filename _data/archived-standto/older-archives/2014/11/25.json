    "body": "**What is it?**\n\nAs Warrior Care Month comes to a close at the end of November, the Army honors the wounded, ill and injured Soldiers who remain strong after transition.  Supporting the broader Warrior Care Month theme of \"Show Your Strength,\" this week's theme is \"Show Your Strength through Remaining Strong.\"\n\n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nWarrior Transition Units (WTUs) empower Soldiers to remain strong by setting them up for success after they transition, either back to the force or to civilian life.  The personalized Comprehensive Transition Plan (CTP) that each Soldier develops provides structure and goals even after their transition, spanning the physical, spiritual, social, emotional, family and career domains.  \n\nFor those who separate from the force, there are career and employment readiness activities, such as completing professional internships, professional certifications and college courses to prepare them to enter the civilian workforce.   \n\nLike all Soldiers, wounded, ill and injured Soldiers are Soldiers for Life.  In collaboration with the Soldier for Life program, WTUs work to ensure exiting Soldiers are embraced by their home communities with opportunities for employment, education and healthcare to remain Army Strong. This includes a strong understanding of how to use applicable federal programs and benefits.\n\n\n**What does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nWTUs will continue to support each Soldier in achieving his/her personalized goals across all aspects of their CTPs -- including career -- to achieve a holistic recovery.  \n\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nRecognizing the contributions of each Soldier, even after they separate from the force, strengthens the Army.  By ensuring that the wounded, ill and injured are prepared for success after transition, the Army honors its sacred obligation to provide these resilient warriors the best possible care and support.\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [WTC Career Planning]( http://www.wtc.army.mil/modules/soldier/s4-careerPlanning.html) \n* [WTC Internships]( http://www.wtc.army.mil/modules/soldier/s3-internships.html)\n* [WTC Employer Resources ]( http://www.wtc.army.mil/modules/employers/index.html)\n* [Soldier for Life]( http://soldierforlife.army.mil/)\n* [Warrior Care Month Army]( http://www.wtc.army.mil/wtc/warrior_care_month_2014.html)\n* [Warrior Care Month DOD](http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2014/1014_warriorcare/)\n* Related Stand-To!:  \n* [- Warrior Care Month](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-10-28/)\n* [- Warrior Care Month Recovery]( http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-11-04/)\n* [- Warrior Care Month Reconditioning]( http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-11-12/?s_cid=standto)\n* [- Warrior Care Month Reintegration]( http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-11-18/)\n",
