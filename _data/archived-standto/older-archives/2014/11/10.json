    "body": "On Veterans Day, we pause to honor and remember the men and women who have served during war and peace, defending our country and the American way of life. As a nation, we must never forget the debt we owe them for securing the many freedoms we often take for granted.\n\nThe volunteer Army is our nation's strength.  Past and present, our Soldiers represent the honor, courage and commitment to serve that befits the profession of arms.  Soldiers who are serving and those who have served in the active or reserve components are Soldiers for life, permanent members of America's Army.  Whether in Normandy or Okinawa, Korea or Vietnam, Afghanistan or Iraq or elsewhere around the world, our Soldiers served willingly and nobly answered our nation's call.  Through their support, their families have served, too, and equally deserve our respect and appreciation.\n\nEvery one of our Soldiers, veterans and their families have selflessly devoted themselves to serving our great nation. Their gifts are many. This Veterans Day, we encourage you to say thank you to those individuals who have worn the Soldier's uniform. At the same time, please continue to honor our fallen, our Wounded Warriors and those who still serve in defense of our country and its principles.\n\n*View the Army senior leaders tri-signed letter: [2014 Veterans Day](http://www.army.mil/article/137762/)*\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [Presidential Proclamation - Veterans Day, 2014](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/11/07/presidential-proclamation-veterans-day-2014)\n* Related sites: \n* [Army.mil: Veterans](http://www.army.mil/veterans)\n* [Soldier for Life](http://soldierforlife.army.mil/)\n* [Transition resources at Army.mil: Ready & Resilient](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient)  \n* [Army Career & Alumni Program](https://www.acap.army.mil/default.aspx)  \n* [Hero 2 Hired](http://h2h.jobs/)  \n* [U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs: Veterans Day](http://www.va.gov/opa/vetsday/) \n* Related videos: \n* [Army.mil Veterans Playlist](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLitjSv4SbrkwY_9CByuns79OCRmqoP8fL)\n* Related STAND-TO! \n* [- Veterans Day 2013 - Soldier for Life](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-11-07/)\n\n",
