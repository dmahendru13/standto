On Nov. 15, the command celebrates 42 years of delivering environmental solutions to the Army. Some accomplishments include:\n\n-- Through its management of the Army's Active Sites Environmental Restoration Program and the IMCOM Compliance-Related Cleanup Program, USAEC has worked with installations Army-wide to return almost 11,000 of more than 12,000 active sites to beneficial use.\n\n-- USAEC's Cultural Resources experts are available to help installations protect more than 81,000 historic buildings, archeological sites, and Native American sacred sites on Army lands, while finding programmatic solutions that enable the Army to achieve its training mission. \n\n-- Through the EPAAS program, USAEC helps garrisons and installations identify environmental issues that have the potential to reduce or halt training and assist them in finding efficient solutions that will help them achieve mission success.  \n\n\n**What continued effort does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nUSAEC  will continue to work with its partners in the Army Environmental Program, as well as other Department of Defense, regulatory and community stakeholders to deliver environmental solutions that enable Army readiness and promote sound environmental stewardship.  \n\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nEnvironmental restrictions can severely impact and even stop the Army's ability to train its Soldiers so they can accomplish their mission. Through its partnering efforts and providing environmental expertise and customer-focused service, USAEC is helping limit or avoid restrictions on the Army's training lands and ranges.  This enables the Army to continue to provide highly trained Soldiers, ready for any contingency or mission, while sustaining resources for future generations. \n\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [U.S. Army Environmental Command](http://www.aec.army.mil)\n* [Installation Management Command (IMCOM)](http://www.imcom.army.mil/)\n* [Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations, Energy and Environment](http://www.army.mil/asaiee)\n* [Army.mil: Environment News](http://www.army.mil/news/environment/)\n",

That's through getting as much civilian education and credentialing opportunities as they can while on active duty. When a Soldier starts, there should be a plan in place for that individual to start working on college after one year of active federal service. \n\n### - [Sgt. Maj. of the Army Raymond F.
