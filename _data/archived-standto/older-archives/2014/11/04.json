    "body": "**What is it?**\n\nAs the U.S. Army honors [Warrior Care Month](http://www.wtc.army.mil/wtc/warrior_care_month_2014.html) in November, this week's theme is \"Show Your Strength through Recovery.\" This week, the military recognizes the resilience that enables wounded, ill and injured Soldiers and their families to move forward towards a holistic recovery and the professionals who support them throughout the process.\n\n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nTo ensure a holistic recovery, [Warrior Transition Unit (WTU)](http://www.wtc.army.mil/wtc/locations.html) Soldiers build a personalized [Comprehensive Transition Plan (CTP)](http://www.wtc.army.mil/modules/soldier/s1-ctp.html) with short- and long-term goals across six domains: physical, spiritual, social, emotional, family and career.  Family members and caregivers are actively involved in the recovery process, invited to all medical appointments and transition meetings. \n \nIn 2007, the Army established the [Warrior Care and Transition Program](http://www.wtc.army.mil/modules/soldier/s1-wctpProgram.html), including WTUs and incorporating the [Army Wounded Warrior Program (AW2)](http://myarmybenefits.us.army.mil/Home/Benefit_Library/Federal_Benefits_Page/Army_Wounded_Warrior_Program_(AW2).html) to support wounded, ill and injured Soldiers and their families. \n \nToday, at 25 WTUs, each recovering Soldier benefits from a dedicated Triad of Care (primary care manager, nurse case manager and squad leader),who collaborate with a multidisciplinary team of medical and non-medical professionals to ensure each recovering Soldier receives the best possible care and support.  [Army Wounded Warrior Program](http://www.wtc.army.mil/modules/soldier/s2-aw2EligibilityEnrollment.html) (AW2) Advocates also support the most severely wounded.  \n\n\n**What does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nThe Army views support for wounded, ill and injured Soldiers as a sacred obligation and enduring mission.  As Soldiers become wounded, ill and injured in the line of duty, the Army will continue to provide a robust support system throughout the recovery and transition process.\n\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nProviding world-class medical care to all Soldiers and their families has always been a priority to the Army.  Supporting our wounded, ill and injured reaffirms the Army's commitment to a strong Army medical department and reassures the entire Army family that the Army will stand by every Soldier who requires the support of the  [Warrior Care and Transition Program (WCTP)](http://www.wtc.army.mil/about_us/programs.html).\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [Warrior Transition Command](http://www.wtc.army.mil)\n* [Warrior Care and Transition Program (WCTP)](http://www.wtc.army.mil/about_us/programs.html)\n* [Army Wounded Warrior Program (AW2)](http://www.wtc.army.mil/modules/soldier/s2-aw2EligibilityEnrollment.html)\n* [WTC: 2014 Warrior Care Month](http://www.wtc.army.mil/wtc/warrior_care_month_2014.html) \n* [DOD: Warrior Care Month]( http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2014/1014_warriorcare/)\n* Related STAND-TO!: \n* [- Warrior Care Month 2014](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-10-28/?s_cid=standto)  \n",
