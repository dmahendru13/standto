    "body": "**What is it?**\n\nThe Secretary of the Army and the Chief of Staff of the Army co-host the 2015 Army Profession Annual Symposium at West Point, New York, July 26-28, 2015. The APAS theme this year is \"Unveiling our Army Ethic and Stewarding our Profession.\"\n\nThe commanding general of U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command sponsors the event; facilitated by the Center for the Army Profession and Ethic; and supported by the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Invitees include senior Army leaders, both uniformed and civilian, from all components.\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nThe intent of this symposium is for senior Army leaders to address their strategic stewardship requirement to maintain the Army as a Profession and strengthen its essential characteristics. The symposium allows for the review of the recently revised edition of Army Doctrine Reference Publication 1 -- The Army Profession, specifically the Army Ethic chapter. \n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nDuring the inaugural Army Profession Symposium at West Point in July 2014, the CSA and sergeant major of the Army asked senior Army leaders to share their vision for the Army Ethic and then to inspire and motivate those within their organizations, based on the shared identity of trusted Army professionals. \n\nAt the Senior Army Civilian Symposium at the National Defense University in Washington, D.C., in November 2014, the secretary of the Army affirmed the vision for an articulated Army Ethic and its relevance with the civilian cohort. At the Junior Leader Symposium, being held on Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, in February 2015, participants will discuss the expression of the Ethic and its applicability at the operational level. The findings and recommendations from those events led to the development of the revision of ADRP 1  The Army Profession with a new Chapter 2: The Army Ethic, which released in June 2015. The Army also announced the fiscal 2015-16 theme for America's Army -- Our Profession as \"Living the Army Ethic -- Why and How we Serve.\"  \n\n**What efforts does the Army plan to continue in the future?**\n\nThe information and ideas exchanged at this symposium will enable the Army to address institutional and operational opportunities to maintain and strengthen Trust within the Army and with the American people, formulate character-development initiatives, and implement the [Army Ethic](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-06-15/).\n\n**Resources:**\n \n* [Center for the Army Profession and Ethic](http://cape.army.mil/)\n* [U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/)\n* [Mission Command Center of Excellence](http://usacac.army.mil/organizations/mccoe) \n* [Combined Arms Center](http://usacac.army.mil/)\n* [Character Development](http://cape.army.mil/case-studies/vcs-single.php?id=8&title=character-development) \n* Related documents:\n* [- ADRP1: The Army Profession](http://armypubs.army.mil/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_a/pdf/adrp1.pdf) \n* [- Army Ethic White Paper](http://www.army.mil/e2/c/downloads/356486.pdf) \n* [- Living the Army Ethic Tri-Signed Letter](http://cape.army.mil/repository/news/AAOP-Living-the-Army-Ethic-Tri-Signed.pdf) \n* [- FY 15/16 Annual Theme and ALARACT](http://cape.army.mil/aaop/living-the-army-ethic/)\n* Related STAND-TO!:\n* [- The Army Ethic](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-06-15/) \n* [- CSA's Strategic Priorities: Waypoint #2](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-02-24) \n* [- America's Army -- Our Profession \"Stand Strong\"](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-12-16/) \n* [- America's Army -- Our Profession](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/issue.php?issue=2013-01-17) \n* [- Army Leader Development Program](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-04-15/) \n* [- The Army Profession](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/issue.php?issue=2012-04-16) \n",

    "quote": "Quote of the Day\n------------------\n\nThe kinds of leaders - the kinds of service men and women - we require are those who are able to adapt to a shifting security landscape. These are the sorts of individuals who do not just react to change and uncertainty but lead through it. They do not just manage risk and the unknown. Rather, they embrace it to generate opportunity. People who know how to take incredibly complex problems and deliver options, not ultimatums.\n\n### - [Secretary of the Army John McHugh](http://www.army.mil/leaders/sa/), delivering the capstone address to the Army War College Distance Education Class of 2015, in Carlisle, Penn., July 23 \n\n### [Secretary of the Army John M.
