Henry Johnson](http://www.army.mil/medalofhonor/johnson/) will receive the Medal of Honor posthumously for his actions during combat operations in the vicinity of the Tourbe and Aisne Rivers, northwest of Saint Menehoul, France, on May 15, 1918. Command Sgt. Maj. Louis Wilson, representing the New York National Guard, will accept the Medal of Honor on Sgt. Johnson's behalf.\n\n[Sgt.

Sgt. Shemin's daughter, Ms. Elsie Shemin-Roth, will accept the Medal of Honor on her father's behalf.\n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nThe Office of the Chief of Public Affairs created Medal of Honor microsites to pay tribute to Johnson and Shemin, where viewers can access biographies, citations, and interviews about the recipients' heroism above and beyond the call of duty. \n\nThe White House ceremony will be streamed live from the microsites and live tweeted from [#USArmy Twitter](https://twitter.com/usarmy/?from=st) platform. In addition, the Army has published exclusive content for each recipient on the [Army's official Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/USarmy?from=st). \n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nJohnson and Shemin displayed the attributes of a [professional Soldier](http://www.army.mil/e2/c/downloads/336937.pdf), and embodied [the Warrior Ethos](http://www.army.mil/values/warrior.html). The U.S. Army is proud of these Soldiers and pleased to see their professionalism, service and sacrifice recognized - in full view of a new generation. \n\n**What does the Army have planned after the White House Ceremony?**\n\nIn addition to today's ceremony at the White House, the Deputy Secretary of Defense and Army senior leaders will recognize Johnson and Shemin during a Pentagon Hall of Heroes Induction Ceremony, scheduled for 10:00 a.m. on June 3.
