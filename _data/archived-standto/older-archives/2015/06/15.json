    "body": "**What is it?**\n\nThe Army Ethic inspires and motivates the conduct of Army Professionals -- Soldiers and Army civilians -- who are bound together in common moral purpose. It expresses the standard and expectation for all to make right decisions and to take right actions at all times. It is the heart of the Army's shared identity of trusted Army Professional.  \n\nThe Army Ethic has three supporting roles:\n\n* (1) Honorable Servants of the Nation-Professionals of Character\n* (2) Army Experts-Competent Professionals\n* (3) Stewards of the Army Profession- Committed Professionals. \n  \n\nA revised version of [ADRP 1: The Army Profession](http://cape.army.mil/adrp-1/) released  in conjunction with the [U.S. Army's 240th birthday](http://www.army.mil/birthday/?from=st), includes a concise articulation of its ethic in a new Chapter 2: The Army Ethic.  \n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nAs the Army moves further into the 21st century, it enters a period of strategic transition that requires Army professionals to be capable of winning in a complex world.  To become that leader and to reinforce trust within the profession and with the American people, Soldiers and Army Civilians must uphold the moral principles of the Army Ethic in accomplishing their mission, in performing their duty, and in all aspects of life.  \n\nAs members of the Army Profession, the Army practices the profession, consistent with the Army Ethic, reflecting a shared understanding for Why and How We Serve in defense of the American people.  Preservation of the peace and winning the nation's wars is inherent to the Army Ethos- this is *Why We Serve*.  The ethical, effective, and efficient accomplishment of the mission is the core of the ethos- this is *How We Serve*.  \n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nFor the first time in the Army's history it has a clarified, codified, and articulated expression of the Army Ethic.  After two years of extensive study, feedback from the Army, and guidance from senior Army leaders, the Ethic serves as a guide for conduct of both the individual members of the profession and the Army as a whole.  \n\n**What efforts does the Army plan to continue in the future?**\n\nThe Army will continue the FY15-16 *America's Army -- Our Profession*, \"Living the Army Ethic\"  campaign to reinforce *Trust*, inspire *Honorable Service*, strengthen our commitment to ethical, effective, and efficient *Stewardship of the Army Profession*, and enhance *Esprit de Corps*. The \"Living the Army Ethic\" training materials and other supporting products will enhance planning and conduct of professional development and activities.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [The Center for the Army Profession and Ethic (CAPE)](http://cape.army.mil/)\n* [- Character Development](http://cape.army.mil/case-studies/vcs-single.php?id=8&title=character-development) \n* [Mission Command Center of Excellence (MCCoE)](http://usacac.army.mil/organizations/mccoe) \n* [U.S. Army Combined Arms Center](http://usacac.army.mil/)\n* [- Combined Arms Doctrine Development (CADD)](http://usacac.army.mil/organizations/mccoe/cadd) \n* [- Army Training and Support Center (ATSC)]( http://usacac.army.mil/organizations/cact/atsc) \n* [U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC)](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/)\n* Related documents:\n* [- Army Ethic White Paper](http://www.army.mil/e2/c/downloads/356486.pdf) \n* [- Living the Army Ethic Tri-Signed Letter](http://cape.army.mil/repository/news/AAOP-Living-the-Army-Ethic-Tri-Signed.pdf) \n* [- FY 15/16 Annual Theme and ALARACT](http://cape.army.mil/aaop/living-the-army-ethic/)\n* [- ADRP 1: The Army Profession](http://armypubs.army.mil/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_a/pdf/adrp1.pdf)\n* Related STAND-TO!:\n* [- CSA's Strategic Priorities: Waypoint #2](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-02-24) \n* [- The Army Profession](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/issue.php?issue=2012-04-16)\n",
