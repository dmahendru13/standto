    "body": "**What is it?**\n\nThe Army Progressive Motorcycle Program (PMP) requires all Soldiers who own or operate a motorcycle to complete four separate training events at specific time intervals defined in Army Regulation 385-10: the Motorcycle Safety Foundation Basic RiderCourse (BRC), Basic RiderCourse 2 (formerly Experienced RiderCourse) or Military SportBike RiderCourse, motorcycle refresher training, and sustainment training. Required follow-on training must be completed within 12 months of completing the BRC, and sustainment training is required every five years. Refresher training is only required if a rider has been deployed more than 180 days.\n\n**What has Army Safety done?**\n\nCurrent Army accident data show a significant number of fatal motorcycle accidents are due to rider indiscipline, not lack of skills. Speeding, loss of control and alcohol are among the top three factors cited in indiscipline-related accident reports. The PMP addresses rider behavior, teaches basic skills, and builds and improves rider attitude and control throughout a Soldier's riding life. The program is designed to continually re-engage riders while promoting safe behaviors, refreshing skills and establishing lifelong learning among the Army's riding population.\n\n**What does Army Safety have planned for the future?**\n\nThe U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center will work with course instructors and the Army motorcycle community to provide Soldiers an appropriate mix of web-based and hands-on training that emphasizes safe riding, improves rider skills and addresses rider behavior at the initial training level.\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nTotal force sustainment is critical to our nation's defense, and every Soldier has a duty to remain mission ready. Senseless losses due to indiscipline impact unit readiness and the Army's ability to protect our nation. The PMP and other training programs provide lifelong learning opportunities that reinforce safe behaviors and enforce standards, keeping Soldiers safe and ready for the fight.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center](https://safety.army.mil)\n* Related document: \n* [- AR 385-10, The Army Safety Program](http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r385_10.pdf)\n* Related STAND-TO!:\n* [- R2: Risk Reduction and Safety](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-04-08/)\n* [- Army Safety and Occupational Health Objectives](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-12-24/)\n",
