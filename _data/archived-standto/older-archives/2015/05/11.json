Sleep, activity, nutrition, regular checkups and preventive screenings are paramount in improving one's health.\n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nIn 2011, Army Medicine established the [Women's Health Task Force](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/issue.php?issue=2012-08-31) (WHTF), comprised of a team of subject matter experts in a variety of disciplines from the Army, sister services, and outside agencies to address the unique health concerns of women serving in the military, with a focus on deployed healthcare. WHTF-initiatives are designed to optimize and standardize services to women across all services, including the development of clinical treatment algorithms for common gynecological conditions, and standardized women's health education for all Soldiers, leaders, and providers. The WHTF just recently completed their work.\n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nThe Women's Health Service Line (WHSL) was established as part of the Army Medicine 2020 Campaign Plan and Operating Company Model.  The WHSL will align efforts to meet the commander's four priorities to include adopting evidence based practices for coordinated and patient-centric care. By developing a strategy that establishes system-wide services and policies, the WHSL promotes collaboration, decreases redundancy and unwarranted clinical variance, and ultimately improves the quality and satisfaction of care to female beneficiaries.  The WHSL is closely aligned with Soldier 2020 as part of the U.S. Army Medical Department's (AMEDD's) enduring effort to support the integration of women into jobs and units previously closed to females.\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nFemale Service members proudly serve in the nation's military, making up 15.8 percent of the force today including active duty, reserve, and guard. The percentage of females continues to grow, increasing four percent from 20 years ago.  Army Medicine recognizes the magnitude and impact of women's health and appreciates the unique challenges of being a woman in the Army whether Soldier, Family member, or retiree. In order for women to be fully integrated and effective members of the team, the Army must ensure women's unique health needs are addressed.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [Army Medicine](http://armymedicine.mil/pages/home.aspx)\n* [Army Public Health Command](http://phc.amedd.army.mil/topics/healthyliving/wh/Pages/default.aspx)\n* [Women's Health](http://www.womenshealth.gov/)\n* [Healthy Women](http://www.womenshealth.gov/)\n* [Army.mil: Women in the U.S. Army](http://www.army.mil/women/)\n* Related STAND-TO!:\n* [- Performance Triad Pilot Program](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-03-12/)\n* [- Performance Triad: Nutrition](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-01-31/)\n* [- Performance Triad: Sleep](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-02-13/)\n* [- Performance Triad: Activity](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-02-27/)\n* [- The Women's Health Task Force](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/issue.php?issue=2012-08-31)\n",
