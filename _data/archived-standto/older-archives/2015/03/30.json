About 80 wounded, ill and injured active- duty Soldiers, reservists, guardsmen and Army veterans will compete in archery, cycling, track and field, shooting, swimming, sitting volleyball and wheelchair basketball.

[Adaptive reconditioning activities](http://go.usa.gov/3Y46Y), including adaptive sports,  are a valuable recovery tool incorporated into the WTU Soldiers' recovery plans across the Army. Adaptive reconditioning enables healing in a multitude of ways: mentally, personally, emotionally, and physically. \n\n\n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\n[Adaptive sports and reconditioning](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-11-12/) are linked to a variety of benefits for wounded, ill and injured service members across the military branches:\n\n* -Decreased stress\n* -Increased self-confidence\n* -Reduced dependency on pain and depression medication\n* -Increased mobility\n* -Higher achievement in education and employment\n* -Promotes relationships with other Soldiers and the community\n* -Promotes new life skills that contribute to successful transitions\n\nParticipation in sports, and as part of a team, also helps Soldiers adapt more easily and may lessen behavioral health problems.\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nNot only do the U.S. Army Warrior Trials showcase the resilience, strength and abilities of the Army's wounded, ill and injured, they also highlight the Army's commitment to these Soldiers, veterans and their Families. Army Trials reinforce the commitment of the Army to provide care and transition support for all of its Soldiers wounded, ill and injured.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [Army Trials](https://www.dvidshub.net/feature/ArmyTrials)\n* [Warrior Transition Command](http://www.wtc.army.mil/)\n* [Performance Triad](http://phc.amedd.army.mil/topics/healthyliving/perftriad/Pages/default.aspx)\n* [Army.mil: Ready and Resilient](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient/)\n* [Army.mil: Soldier for Life](http://www.army.mil/soldierforlife/)\n* [Comprehensive Soldier and Family Fitness](http://csf2.army.mil/)\n* WTC on social media:\n* [- Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ArmyWTC)\n* [- Twitter](https://twitter.com/armyWTC)\n* [- Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/armywtc)\n* [- YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/WarriorCareCom)\n* Related STAND-TO!:\n* [- Warrior Care Month: Remaining Strong](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-11-25/)\n* [- Warrior Care Month: Reintegration](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-11-18/)\n* [- Warrior Care Month: Reconditioning](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-11-12/)\n* [- Warrior Care Month: Show Your Strength through Recovery](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-11-04/)\n* [- Warrior Care Month](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-10-28/)\n",
