    "body": "**What is it?**\n\nThe Global Force Symposium is an important platform for the U.S. Army to communicate its needs for current and future operational environments while also providing unique professional development opportunities for Army personnel. \n\nThe 2015 Global Force Symposium, a forum for Army professionals to discuss future armed conflict and what the Army must do to \"Win in a Complex World,\" will take place from March 31 to April 2 at the Von Braun Center in Huntsville, Alabama. \n\n[U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command](http://www.tradoc.army.mil), headquartered at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia, is the Army lead for the 2015 symposium. The theme for this year's event highlights the Army Operating Concept, \"Win in a Complex World.\" \n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nThe annual event, hosted by the Association of the United States Army, this year explores the capabilities outlined in the AOC and how the force transforms from being adaptive to driving innovation for [Force 2025 and Beyond](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-03-27/). Senior Army and industry leaders address critical points of acquisition, research and development, and partnering between military and industry. \n\nThis exposition allows members of the [Army Profession](http://cape.army.mil/aaop/) to take part in unique professional development activities, both in person and virtually, to increase their understanding of the challenges facing the future Army.\n\nThe open professional development forums discuss topics such as: \n\n* -Army warfighting challenges \n* -Increasing the rate of innovation \n* -Force 2025 and Beyond Maneuvers\n* -Science and technology driving innovation for Force 2025 and Beyond\n* -Building leaders who thrive in chaos\n* -Systems engineering and acquisition for the cyber challenge\n* -Sustaining Army readiness to *Win in a Complex World.*  \n\nThe event will be live streamed for Soldiers, Army civilians and family members to watch and submit questions to Army leaders and experts via the event's [live streaming webpage](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/watch). \n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nTRADOC's mission is to ensure future Army forces are prepared to \"Win in a Complex World,\" and to modernize the force through identifying the capabilities the Army must possess to accomplish missions in support of national policy.  \n\nThe Army will continue to seek platforms like the Global Force Symposium to engage key audiences, amplify messages and enhance opportunities for successful government/industry partnering.\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nThe [Army Operating Concept](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-12-22/) is the start point for developing the future force. The AOC describes how future Army forces will prevent conflict, shape security environments and win wars while operating as part of a joint force and working with multiple partners. The Global Force Symposium provides members of the Army Profession an opportunity to learn about many of the key ideas and initiatives that will ultimately define the future Army.  \n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [Watch the Global Force Symposium](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/watch)\n* [Global Force Symposium live stream schedule](http://go.usa.gov/3xsUG)\n* [U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command](http://www.tradoc.army.mil)\n* [Army Material Command](http://www.army.mil/info/organization/unitsandcommands/commandstructure/amc/)\n* [Association of the United States Army](http://www.ausa.org)\n* Related article:\n* [- Watch, join the conversation as senior leaders discuss the future of the Army](http://www.army.mil/article/144430/)\n* Related STAND-TO!: \n* [- Force 2025 and Beyond](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-03-27/)\n* [- The Army Operating Concept](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-12-22/)\n\n",
