    "body": "Veterans Day has both historic and patriotic significance as we pause to show past and present Service members our appreciation for their valiant choice to serve in America's Armed Forces. This year we proudly celebrate more than 21 million living Veterans, more than 9 million of whom served in the U.S. Army. These men and women represent the experience, technical skills and prestige of a noble profession.\n\nIt is important that we honor and thank the brave men and women who selflessly served our country and risked their lives to protect our freedoms.  President John F. Kennedy said, \"As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them.\"\n\n[Army Veterans](http://www.army.mil/veterans/?from=stf1) are [Soldiers for Life](https://soldierforlife.army.mil/), and deserve enduring access to resources even after separating from military service. To this end, we are committed to providing support to Soldiers during their military career as well as after separation from service. We continue to advance these efforts through initiatives with other federal agencies and industry leaders to ensure Veterans are connected with opportunities for employment, education and healthcare.\n\nJoin us in celebrating our Veterans for their legacy of honorable service and dedication to our Nation. These men and women represent the highest ideals of service and patriotism to our country. \n \n\nDownload the Army senior leaders tri-signed letter: [*Veterans Day 2015*](http://www.army.mil/e2/rv5_downloads/veterans/veterans_day_2015_trisign.pdf)\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [Presidential Proclamation - Veterans Day, 2015](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/11/05/presidential-proclamation-veterans-day-2015)\n* [U.S. Army Veterans](http://www.army.mil/veterans/?from=stf)\n* [Soldier for Life](https://soldierforlife.army.mil/)\n* [Transition resources at Army.mil: U.S. Army Ready and Resilient](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient/transition/?from=stf) \n* [Army Career & Alumni Program](https://www.acap.army.mil/default.aspx)\n* [Hero 2 Hired](http://h2h.jobs/)\n* Related STAND-TO!: \n* [- Army Transition - Hero 2 Hired](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-03-24/) \n* [- Veterans Day - Soldier for Life](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-11-07/)\n",
