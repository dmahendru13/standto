Florent Groberg](http://go.usa.gov/3uHZ5), during a ceremony at the White House today at 11:15 a.m. EST. Groberg is only the tenth Solider to earn the Medal of Honor for operations in Afghanistan. \n\n**What has the Army done?**\n \nThe Office of the Chief of Public affairs has created a Medal of Honor microsite to pay tribute to [Capt. (Ret.) Florent Groberg's](http://go.usa.gov/3uHZ5) actions above and beyond the call of duty, in Asadabad, Kunar Province, Afghanistan on Aug. 8, 2012. Visitors to the multi-media rich site can access a firsthand account of Groberg's actions in [his own words](http://www.army.mil/medalofhonor/groberg/?from=st#battle), as well as the official battle narrative, [his biography](http://www.army.mil/medalofhonor/groberg/?from=st#biography), [unit history](http://www.army.mil/medalofhonor/groberg/?from=st#team), and award citation. \n\nThe White House ceremony will be streamed live from the microsite and live tweeted from [#USArmy Twitter](https://twitter.com/usarmy/?from=stf) platform.

During the attack in Asadabad, Groberg lived out the [Soldier's Creed](http://www.army.mil/values/soldiers.html?from=stf) as he placed himself between a suicide bomber and his teammates. Today, Groberg employs his competence, character, and commitment within a new profession, living the [Army Values](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2013-08-15/?from=st_mohgr) alongside citizens he once served.\n \n**What does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nIn addition to today's ceremony at the White House, the Secretary of Defense and Army senior leaders will recognize Capt.
