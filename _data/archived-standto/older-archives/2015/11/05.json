    "body": "**What is it?** \n \nEstablished in 2003 by the Armed Services YMCA, Military Family Month (MFM) is observed in November to recognize and honor Families of service members for their unique contributions and sacrifices while supporting the Army mission. MFM reiterates the Army's commitment to strengthen the readiness and resilience of the Army Family.\n\nThis year's theme is \"Military Families: Keeping Our Army Strong!\" The collective strength of the Army depends on the people -- including Family members. Families play a huge role in every phase of the Soldier life cycle. They help Soldiers start strong, serve strong, reintegrate strong and remain strong throughout their careers.\n\n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nEach November, government, military, community and business leaders team up to recognize military Families through events and activities such as Family fun nights, fun runs, discounts at Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) facilities, sporting events and special recognition during community activities. Active, Guard, and Reserve leaders and Department of Defense organizations such as the Army Air Force Exchange Service and the Defense Commissary Agency frequently team up to conduct activities and events to express their appreciation for military Families.\n\nDuring this month, all commands, installations and units are encouraged to participate in local engagements designed to draw public attention to and illustrate public support and appreciation for the Army Family.\n\n**What does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nThe Army is fully committed to helping Families remain Army Strong by offering a variety of programs and services through the garrison MWR programs, [Army Community Service](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-07-23/) programs and Child Youth and School Services. These programs ensure the [Army Families](http://www.army.mil/families/?from=stf)\n remain supported and connected to the Army and the nation.\n\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?** \n\nThe strength of the nation is built on the readiness and resilience of every member of the premier all-volunteer Army including Family members. Families are the force behind the force, allowing Soldiers to focus on their mission of serving the nation. The Army recognizes and appreciates the commitment, contributions and sacrifices of the [Army Families](http://www.army.mil/families/?from=stf). \n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [U.S. Army Family & Morale, Welfare and Recreation](http://www.armymwr.com)\n* [U.S. Army Installation Management Command](http://www.imcom.army.mil)\n* [Army OneSource](http://www.myarmyonesource.com/default.aspx)\n* [Military OneSource](http://www.militaryonesource.mil)\n* [Army.mil: Army Families](http://www.army.mil/families/?from=stf)\n* [Army Family Strong](http://www.goarmy.com/soldier-life/army-family-strong.html)\n* [Army Family Readiness Groups](http://www.armyfrg.org/skins/frg/home.aspx)\n* [Armed Services YMCA](http://www.asymca.org)\n* Related Social Media: \n* [IMCOM on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/InstallationManagementCommunity)\n* [Army MWR on Facebook](https://www.Facebook.com/FamilyMWR)\n* Related STAND-TO!: \n* [- Army Community Service](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-07-23/)\n* [- Month of the Military Child: \"Their Lives, Their Stories\"](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-04-02/)",
