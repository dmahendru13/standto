    "body": "**What is it?**\n \n[The Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center](http://www.dliflc.edu/ ) (DLIFC) provides culturally based foreign language education, training, evaluation and sustainment to enhance the security of the nation. DLIFLC, the Department of Defense's premier foreign language provider, is regarded as one of the finest schools for foreign language instruction in the world. \n\nThe institute provides resident instruction in 23 languages to approximately 3,500 military service members, five days a week, seven hours per day, with two to three hours of homework each night. Courses last between 26 and 64 weeks.  Upon successful completion of this rigorous training, students can receive an Associate of Arts degree.\n\n\n**What has Army done?**\n\nThe Army provides and supports excellence in foreign language acquisition and maintenance for all service members at DLIFLC. Since 2002, service members attending the institute have also been able to earn an accredited Associate of Arts degree in foreign language upon successful graduation from their program. Nearly 12,000 associate degrees have been awarded since DLIFLC became accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. The Army has succeeded in making it possible for students to receive the two-year college degree in six to 18 months, depending on the length of the student's language program, with 45 DLIFLC credits and 18 units transferred from other accredited institutions or authorized sources. \n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nDLIFLC will be part of the [Army University](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-06-17/), which encompasses all 37 U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command schools. The Army launched the Army University in 2015 with the intent to create a single point university structure that will maximize educational opportunities for Soldiers by providing valid academic credit for the education and experience they receive while on active duty. DLIFLC is already meeting this standard through quality language education.\n\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?** \n\nEducation is the most reliable strategic investment the Army can make to address Army warfighting challenges. Speaking another language and understanding the cultures of other nations will help the Army in building foreign partnerships and enhance cooperation with those countries. These skills will also create opportunity for those who are transitioning into the civilian sector, making them [Soldiers for Life](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-01-17/). \n\n\n \n**Resources:**\n\n* [U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command](http://www.tradoc.army.mil)\n* [Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center](http://www.dliflc.edu/)\n* [- DLIFLC Associate of Arts Degree](http://dliflc.edu/registrar/#homepage-tab|1)\n* Related documents: \n* [- The Army Profession](http://armypubs.army.mil/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_a/pdf/adrp1.pdf)\n* [- The Army University White Paper; Feb. 25, 2015](http://go.usa.gov/3EXgm)\n* [- Strategic Business Plan for the Army University; Mar. 16, 2015](http://go.usa.gov/3EXgA)\n* [- TRADOC PAM 525-3-1: The US Army Operating Concept: Win in a Complex World; Oct. 31, 2014](http://www.tradoc.army.mil/tpubs/pams/TP525-3-1.pdf)\n* Related STAND-TO!: \n* [- Soldier for Life](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-01-17/)\n* [- The Army University](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-06-17/)\n* [- The U.S. Army Operating Concept](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-12-22/)\n* [- Force 2025 and Beyond](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-03-27/)\n* Related articles:\n* [- Recruiting command commits to bringing on more linguists](http://www.army.mil/article/155731/Recruiting_command_commits_to_bringing_on_more_linguists/)\n* [- TRADOC deputy talks culture and language at DLIFLC](http://www.army.mil/article/155005/)\n* [- Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center celebrates Language Day 2015](http://www.army.mil/article/148390/Defense_Language_Institute_Foreign_Language_Center_celebrates_Language_Day_2015/)\n",
