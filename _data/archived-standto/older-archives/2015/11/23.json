    "body": "**What is it?** \n\nThe U.S. Army continues to honor the strength shown by wounded, ill and injured Soldiers and their Families after making their transition back to the force or into civilian life.  In keeping with the overarching theme for the 2015 Warrior Care Month commemoration *Show of Strength*, this week's theme is *Show Your Strength through Remaining Strong.*\n\n**What has Army done?**\n\nWarrior Transition Units (WTUs) empower Soldiers to remain strong by setting them up for success after they transition back to the force or into the civilian workforce.  The personalized Comprehensive Transition Plan (CTP) each Soldier develops, spans the physical, spiritual, social, emotional, Family and career domains, and provides structure and goals even after their transition.  \n\nFor those who separate from the force, there are Career and Employment Readiness activities such as professional internships, professional certifications and college courses to prepare them to enter the civilian workforce.  \n \nWounded, ill and injured Soldiers, like all Soldiers, remain Soldiers for Life.  In collaboration with the Soldier for Life program, WTUs support transitioning Soldiers in their quest to seek education and employment opportunities, as well as provide them with a sound understanding of how to use federal programs and benefits.\n\n\n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nWTUs will continue to support each Soldier in achieving his/her personalized goals across all aspects of their CTP -- including their short- and long-term career goals -- in order for them to achieve a holistic recovery.  \n\n**Why is this important to the Army?** \n\nRecognizing the contributions of each Soldier, even after they separate from the force, strengthens the Army.  By ensuring wounded, ill and injured Soldiers are fully prepared for success after transition, the Army honors its sacred obligation to provide these resilient warriors the best possible care and support.\n  \n \n**Resources:**\n\n\n* Army Senior Leaders Tri-signed letter: [Warrior Care Month 2015- Show of Strength](http://www.wtc.army.mil/pressRoom/pressReleases/Warrior_Care_Month_Signed_2015.pdf)\n* [Warrior Transition Command](http://www.wtc.army.mil/) \n* [- Career Planning](http://www.wtc.army.mil/modules/soldier/s4-careerPlanning.html)\n* [- Internships](http://www.wtc.army.mil/modules/soldier/s3-internships.html)\n* [- Employment Resources](http://www.wtc.army.mil/modules/employers/index.html)\n* [- Warrior Care Month](http://www.wtc.army.mil/wtc/warrior_care_month_2015.html)\n* [Department of Defense Warrior Care Month](http://www.defense.gov/News/Special-Reports/1015_warriorcare)\n* [Soldier for Life](https://soldierforlife.army.mil/)\n* [U.S. Army Ready and Resilient](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient/?from=stf)\n* Related STAND-TO!: \n* [- Warrior Care Month:Reintegration](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-11-16/)\n* [- Warrior Care Month: Reconditioning](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-11-09/)\n* [- Warrior Care Month: Show Your Strength through Recovery](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-11-02/)\n* [- Soldier for Life](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-01-17/)\n",
