    "body": "**What is it?** \n\nThe U.S. Army's Diversity and Inclusion Roadmap (ADIR) supports [Force 2025 and Beyond](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-03-27/) and contributes to mission readiness while transforming and sustaining the Army as a global leader in diversity.  The new ADIR is scheduled to be published in fiscal year 2016.  \n\n\n**What has Army done?**\n\nThe ADIR supports Soldiers, civilians and Family members through an ambitious plan focusing on actions that enable the Army to prepare for a changing America.  The Army is committed to recruiting, developing and retaining America's best talent.  The following internal structure supports the ADIR:\n\n* (1) [The U.S. Army Diversity and Leadership Agency](http://www.asamra.army.mil/org_diversity.cfm) (USAD&LA): \nThe USAD&LA develops policies, programs and strategies that support a culture of diversity and inclusion that is free from unlawful discrimination and prohibited personnel practices and maximizes readiness for every Soldier, civilian and Family member.  \n\n* (2) The Army Diversity Council (ADC): \nThe ADC is chaired by the Secretary of the Army and the Chief of Staff, and functions as a senior, strategic-level body that leads and supports the Army's diversity and inclusion efforts. \n\n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nThe USAD&LA will develop and integrate a diversity and inclusion curriculum and competencies throughout the Professional Military Education (PME) system and the [Civilian Education System](http://www.civiliantraining.army.mil/Leader/Pages/default.aspx) (CES). \nThe Army will enhance existing programs, to include diversity and inclusion training for newly selected brigadier generals and members of the senior executive service.  In addition, the Army will continue to synchronize enterprise wide outreach activities with national special interest and affinity groups. \n\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?** \n\nAn inclusive mindset is crucial to recruiting, retaining and developing the human talent necessary to maintain readiness.  A diverse Army represents the American people and demonstrates the strength of the committed men and women from different backgrounds working together to support the nation's defense.  \n\nThe Army's commitment to diversity facilitates cultural understanding and exemplifies the American principles.\n\n \n**Resources:**\n\n* [Army Diversity](http://www.armydiversity.army.mil)\n* [- Army Diversity Roadmap (2010)]( http://www.armydiversity.army.mil/document/Diversity_Roadmap.pdf)\n* [- Army Diversity Goals](http://www.armydiversity.army.mil/adoGoals/)\n* [The Assistant Secretary of the Army Manpower & Reserve Affairs- Diversity and Leadership](http://www.asamra.army.mil/org_diversity.cfm)\n* [Equal Employment Opportunity](http://eeoa.army.pentagon.mil)\n* Related STAND-TO!\n* [- Force 2025 and Beyond](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-03-27/)\n* [- The U.S. Army Operating Concept](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-12-22/)\n* [- Army Diversity Roadmap](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive/2011/04/08/)\n\n\n\n",
