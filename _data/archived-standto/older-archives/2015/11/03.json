    "body": "***Growing Native Leaders: Enhancing Seven Generations***\n\nThroughout the [Army's 240 year history](http://www.army.mil/birthday/?from=st), Native Americans have served valiantly and with distinction in times of peace and war, while fighting for the right to be an equal part of our Nation. During Native American Heritage Month, we recognize and celebrate the accomplishments of this country's original inhabitants, explorers and settlers.\n\nNative Americans have a distinguished legacy of service in the Army.  From the early days of the Revolutionary War to today, thousands have served in critical positions, including as guides with the Lewis and Clark expedition, as Scouts with the U.S. Cavalry and as [Code Talkers in World War II](http://www.army.mil/americanindians/code_talkers.html?from=st). Notably, 27 [Native Americans have earned the Medal of Honor](http://www.army.mil/medalofhonor/keeble/medal/airecipients.html?from=st) for their courage and devotion to our Nation. This legacy of distinguished service continues today as Native Americans serve with honor and distinction around the world.\n\nThe Army is proud of the lasting contributions Native Americans continue to make as Soldiers, Civilians, Veterans and Family members in professions that will benefit the Nation and the Army for many years to come.
