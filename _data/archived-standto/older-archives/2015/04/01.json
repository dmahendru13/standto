    "body": "**What is it?**\n\nSexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month (SAAPM) is observed every April to raise awareness and educate communities on the prevention of sexual violence. The [Army's 2015 SAAPM](http://www.preventsexualassault.army.mil/SAAMSplashPage.cfm?CFID=4108822&CFTOKEN=49602130) theme is \"Not in My Squad. Not in Our Army. We Are Trusted Professionals.\"  \n\nThis theme emphasizes the ethical commitment each member of the total Army Family, from the squad level on up, must adopt to ensure every Soldier, [Department of the Army Civilian](http://cpol.army.mil/), and their Family members are treated with dignity and respect.\n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nThe Army, in conjunction with the Department of Defense (DOD), began observing SAAPM, previously called \"Sexual Assault Awareness Month (SAAM),\" in 2005 to reaffirm its commitment to eradicating sexual assault and sexual harassment in the ranks and within Army communities. Agencies and organizations throughout the Army plan and execute commemorative activities to celebrate SAAPM. Many have partnered with outside organizations to spread awareness through local communities. \n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nThrough coordinated planning of special events, Army commanders and [SHARP](http://www.preventsexualassault.army.mil/index.cfm) proponents will continue to raise awareness, internal and external media attention, and momentum for preventing and ending sexual violence.\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nSAAPM is an opportunity to highlight the corrosive effect sexual assault has on Soldiers, unit readiness, team cohesion, command climate, and trust. Sexual harassment and sexual assault violate the core [Army Values](http://www.army.mil/values), the [Warrior Ethos](http://www.army.mil/values/warrior.html), and the nation's trust in leaders. By taking part in SAAPM activities, the Army demonstrates its commitment to cultivating a culture focused on trust, dignity and respect that reaffirms the Army's reputation as a mission-ready, values-based organization.\n\n**Resources:**\n \n* [Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention](http://www.preventsexualassault.army.mil/index.cfm)\n* [- Army 2015 SAAPM](http://www.preventsexualassault.army.mil/SAAMSplashPage.cfm?CFID=4108822&CFTOKEN=49602130)\n* [Ready and Resilient - Personnel Readiness](http://www.army.mil/readyandresilient/personnel)\n* [Army Values](http://www.army.mil/values/)\n* Related articles:\n* [- Dailey to bring Soldiers to Washington to 'own' SHARP problem, solution](http://www.army.mil/article/145180)\n* [- CSA's remarks at SASC Posture Hearing](http://www.army.mil/article/144794)\n* [- Odierno, Dailey emphasize trust at Army's SHARP Academy](http://www.army.mil/article/143546)\n* [- Legislation changes UCMJ for victims of sexual assault](http://www.army.mil/article/140807)\n* [- Increased SHARP training furthers efforts to combat sexual abuse](http://www.army.mil/article/130255)\n* [- Sexual assault victims have right to military attorney](http://www.army.mil/article/135942)\n* [- Smartphone app aids victims of sexual assault](http://www.army.mil/article/125731)\n* Related STAND-TO!:\n* [- 8th I.
