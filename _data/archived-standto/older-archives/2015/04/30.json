    "body": "**What is it?**\n\nEnterprise Talent Management (ETM) program is the means by which the Army prepares its GS-13s and GS-12s (that meet the prerequisites) to gain professional senior-level educational, developmental learning, and experiential opportunities to assume duty positions of greater responsibility across the department. \n\n\n**What has the Army done?** \n\nSigned into policy April 10, 2015, by [Secretary of the Army John McHugh](http://www.army.mil/leaders/sa/), the new [Army Directive 2015-24](http://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/pdf/ad2015_24.pdf) covers two talent management programs:  \n\n- [Senior Enterprise Talent Management](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-04-28/) (SETM) Program for GS-14s/15s and their equivalent grades/pay scales. \n\nThe ETM Program has four modules:\n\n (1) *ETM Command and General Staff Officer College:* This module is designed to expand participants' knowledge of the operational and tactical Army in preparation for the challenges faced in a complex global environment. \n\n(2) *ETM Executive Leader Development Program:* A 10-week program covering 10 months of learning and training experiences that require mental and physical agility.  \n\n(3) *ETM Temporary Duty:* Participants will fill a 90-day or less developmental assignment on a special project as a member of a working group, tiger team or will fill a critical-need detail.  \n\n(4) *ETM Shadowing Experience:* The Shadowing module is designed to provide applicants with up to 20 duty days of structured leadership and shadowing experience with a senior GS-15s or Senior Executive Service civilian.  \n\nThe application period for ETM will be open until May 15, 2015, by using the [SETM Automated System website](https://www.csldo.army.mil/).\n\n\n**Why is it important to the Army?**\n\nThe Army Civilian Corps in the grades of GS-12s/13s and their equivalents comprise more than 65,000 civilians that represent the future of Army Civilian leadership.  Following in the footsteps of the successful [Senior Enterprise Talent Management program](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-04-28/), Army civilians will now have another rung to their leadership development ladder. \n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\n[The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs](http://www.asamra.army.mil/) is working in collaboration with HQDA AG1-CP, G-3/5/7 TRV and major commands on developing a command-based initiative called Emerging Enterprise Leader (EEL) talent development program for GS-11s/12s and their equivalent pay plans.  \n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [Civilian Workforce Transformation](http://www.asamra.army.mil/cwt/)\n* CAC log-in required:\n* [- SETM Automated System](https://www.csldo.army.mil/)\n* [- Civilian Senior Leader Management Office](https://www.cslmo.army.mil/)\n* [Army Civilian Training and Leader Development](http://www.civiliantraining.army.mil/)\n* Related document: \n* [- Army Directive 2015-24 (DA SETM/ETM Program)](http://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/pdf/ad2015_24.pdf)\n* Related article: \n* [- Open application period for Army Civilian leadership training](http://www.army.mil/article/145178)\n* Related STAND-TO!:\n* [- Army Senior Enterprise Talent Management Program](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-04-28/)\n* [- Civilian Workforce Transformation](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-04-17/)\n\n",
