    "body": "**What is it?**\n\nThe Senior Enterprise Talent Management (SETM) program was created in response to a directive from Secretary of the Army in 2009 to produce senior civilian leaders with an enterprise perspective who could serve in increasing levels of responsibility.  SETM is just one of the many programs developed under the Civilian Workforce Transformation initiative and is administered by the Civilian Senior Leader Management Office (CSLMO), Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower and Reserve Affairs).  \n\n\n**What has the Army done?**\n \n[Army Directive 2015-24](http://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/pdf/ad2015_24.pdf)was signed into policy April 10, 2015, by [Secretary of the Army John McHugh](http://www.army.mil/leaders/sa/), and covers two talent management programs:  SETM and Enterprise Talent Management (ETM).  This directive allows GS-12s through GS-15s and their equivalent to gain professional senior-level educational, developmental learning and experiential opportunities.  \n\nInformation paper on ETM will be published in the April 30 STAND-TO!.\n\nThe SETM Program, for GS-14s/GS-15s, has five modules:\n\n(1a) Enterprise Placement Program Option 1 - Reassignment:  Only open to GS-15s, who applies and are selected as Army Enterprise employees willing to be reassigned for leader development. \n\n(1b) Enterprise Placement Program Option 2 - SES Detail:  Open to senior GS-15s to be temporarily detailed to a Senior Executive Service position for up to 1 year. \n\n(2) Army Senior Civilian Fellowship:  A two-year fellowship for GS-14s/15s that expand fellows' opportunities for strategic training, education and professional development through exposure working with DOD agencies, corporations, foundations and educational institutions.  \n\n(3) Defense Senior Leader Development Program:  A 2-year program for GS-14/15s, designed to develop the enterprise-wide perspective needed to lead in joint organizations and across a broad interagency spectrum or multi-national environment. \n\n(4) Senior Service College:  Open to GS-14s/15s or equivalent employees, who compete for allocated seats at the [U.S. Army War College](http://www.carlisle.army.mil/) or Dwight D. Eisenhower School for National Security and Resource Strategy.  \n\n(5) Project-Based Temporary Duty:  A 179-day developmental assignment for GS-14/15s where participants are temporarily assigned to work on a special command-nominated project as part of a working group or to fill a critical needs detail.  \n\nThe application period for SETM will be open until May 15, 2015, by using the SETM Automated System website.\n\n**Why is it important to the Army?**\n\nThe Army Civilian Corps makes up about 22 percent of the total Army force with almost 298,000 professionals serving in nearly 500 unique job series.  Within the past 10 years, more than 29,000 Army civilians have deployed in support of military operations around the world.  Our Army demands that civilian employees commit to a lifetime of personal and professional growth.  SETM prepares our senior civilian leaders for enterprise-level responsibilities for today and the Army of 2025.\n\n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nThe Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs, in collaboration with the Civilian Senior Leader Management Office and the Civilian Workforce Transformation Initiative, will continue to assess the needs of the senior civilian population and develop additional SETM/ETM program modules.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [Civilian Workforce Transformation](http://www.asamra.army.mil/cwt/)\n* CAC log in required: \n* [- SETM Automated System](https://www.csldo.army.mil/)   \n* [- Civilian Senior Leader Management Office](https://www.cslmo.army.mil/)\n* [Army Civilian Training and Leader Development](http://www.civiliantraining.army.mil/)\n* Related document: \n* [Army Directive 2015-24: (DA SETM/ETM Program)](http://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/pdf/ad2015_24.pdf)\n* Related article: \n* [- Open application period for Army Civilian leadership training](http://www.army.mil/article/145178/)\n* Related STAND-TO!: \n* [- Civilian Workforce Transformation](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-04-17/)\n",
