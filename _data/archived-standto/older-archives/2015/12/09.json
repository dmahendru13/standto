    "body": "**What is it?**\n\nRoadrageous is an eight-hour classroom course addressing the root causes of aggressive driving. Produced by the American Institute for Public Safety, the training combines instruction, skits, games, videos, student-instructor interaction and student-student interaction to help drivers acknowledge their negative driving habits and attitudes. The goal is to give students a toolkit to change their behavior and decision-making processes behind the wheel.\n\n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nThe U.S. Army selected Roadrageous training as part of its current [Army Traffic Safety Training Program](http://imcom.army.mil/Portals/0/hq/organization/safety/Safety_Training_Program_FAQ.pdf). The purpose is to provide driver improvement and remedial training for military or civilian personnel convicted of a moving traffic violation or determined to be at fault for a traffic mishap while operating a government motor vehicle. In addition, commanders may refer \"high-risk\" Soldiers to attend the course.\n\n\n**What does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nThe director of [Army Safety](https://safety.army.mil/) encourages organizations to include Roadrageous training as part of their accident prevention efforts. Roadrageous is provided through Cape Fox Government Services. Unit leaders seeking to obtain Roadrageous training for their Soldiers should contact their garrison safety office.\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?** \n\nIndependent studies have shown Roadrageous training to be effective in reducing collisions by 64 to 74 percent. Preventing motor vehicle accidents preserves valuable resources while protecting Soldiers and civilians from injury or death.\n \n \n**Resources:**\n\n* [U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center](https://safety.army.mil)\n* [USACRC PMV-4 tools and resources](https://safety.army.mil/OFF-DUTY/PMV-4.aspx)\n* Related documents: \n* [- Army Regulation 385-10, The Army Safety Program](http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r385_10.pdf)\n* [- Army Traffic Safety Training Program](http://imcom.army.mil/Portals/0/hq/organization/safety/Safety_Training_Program_FAQ.pdf)\n* Related STAND-TO!: \n* [- Army Readiness Assessment Program](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-10-27/)\n* USACRC on social media:\n* [- Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/US-Army-Combat-ReadinessSafety-Center/61118583543)\n* [- Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/SafetyCenter)\n",
