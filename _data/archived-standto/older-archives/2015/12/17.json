    "body": "**What is it?**\n\n[The U.S. Army Security Assistance Training Management Organization]( http://www.usasac.army.mil/usasatmo.aspx) (USASATMO) is a [U.S. Army Security Assistance Command](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-07-20/) (USASAC) subordinate organization under U.S. Army Materiel Command that deploys U.S.-based teams to execute security assistance missions outside the continental United States. The brigade-equivalent command is headquartered at Fort Bragg, N.C., and employs more than 270 Soldiers, Department of Army Civilians and contractors who are deployed to more than 25 countries throughout the year to meet the requirements of foreign nations requesting training assistance.\n\n**What has the Army done?**\n\nUSASATMO's training spans a wide range of specialties and is not restricted to just equipment or systems, but includes everything from Warrior Leader Training to preparation for U.S. Special Forces training.  The organization has successfully deployed training and advisory teams to every geographic combatant command, hence the motto *Training the World, One Soldier at a Time.*  Their mission is vital to achieving U.S. national security objectives and stability in various key locations throughout the world.\n\n**What does the Army have planned for the future?**\n\nUSASATMO's training spans a wide range of specialties and is not restricted to just equipment or systems, but includes everything from Warrior Leader Training to preparation for U.S. Special Forces training.  The organization has successfully deployed training and advisory teams to every geographic combatant command, hence the motto *Training the World, One Soldier at a Time.*  Their mission is vital to achieving U.S. national security objectives and stability in various key locations throughout the world.\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nIn addition to executing Security Assistance missions worldwide, USASATMO advises and recommends Security Assistance-related training solutions to U.S. diplomatic missions, builds partner nation capacity, supports combatant commands, and strengthens U.S. global partnerships.  USASATMO missions abroad promote regional stability, deter aggression, maintain alliances and spread democratic values between the United States and its allies. Tailoring training to partner nations' specific needs ensures interoperability with the U.S. military, a key to the Army's Prevent, Shape and Win strategy.  \n\nUltimately, as partner nations increase their capabilities to aid and defend themselves, it reduces the number of personnel the United States has to deploy.  The organization's training mission is also key to USASAC'S [Total Package Approach](http://www.apd.army.mil/pub/eforms/pdf/A5904_R.pdf), which ensures partner nations not only obtain equipment and resources, but also the skills and knowledge to operate and maintain the resources. \n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [U.S. Army Security Assistance Training Management Organization](http://www.usasac.army.mil/usasatmo.aspx)\n* [U.S. Army Security Assistance Command](http://www.usasac.army.mil ) \n* [- CP-12 Safety and Occupational Health](https://safety.army.mil/CP-12.aspx)\n* Related STAND-TO!: \n* [- U.S. Army Security Assistance Command](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2015-07-20/)\n* [- FMS](http://www.army.mil/standto/archive_2014-06-23/)\n* USASAC on social media: \n* [- Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/USASAC/)\n* [- Twitter (@USASAC)](https://twitter.com/usasac)\n* [- Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/usasac/collections/72157625114082164/)\n\n",
