The JLTV family of vehicles provides a leap ahead in protected, networked mobility, with the capability to perform multiple mission roles and evolve to meet changing warfighter needs.  \n\n\n**What are the current and past efforts of the Army?**\n\nThe Army equips Soldiers to fight and win across all domains as part of the Joint Force, and JLTV will provide Soldiers and Marines a flexible package with:\n\n* Connectivity as the first vehicle purpose-built for battlefield networks.\n* Protection similar to the MRAP All-Terrain Vehicle (M-ATV) and substantially greater than the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) but in a lighter and more transportable package than the M-ATV.\n* M-ATV-like protected payload capacity.\n* Improved reliability, fuel efficiency, and maintainability.\n* Transportability by CH-47, CH-53, and inside amphibious transports.\n* Sustainability designed into the system with integrated driver's smart display unit and health management systems.\n\nThe Army and Marine Corps is successfully conducting JLTV production.  In 2018, JLTVs completed a wide range of reliability, transportability, survivability, network, and other testing activities, including an intensive operational test with Soldiers and Marines to ensure warfighters can effectively interact with the JLTV and all its integrated equipment.  The Soldiers and Marines involved in these activities gave valuable feedback that shaped and improved the vehicle's final configuration. \n\n**What are the continued efforts planned by the Army?**\n\nThe Army and Marine Corps began fielding the first JLTVs to the 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division, Fort Stewart, Georgia., in January 2019, along with training for Soldier operators and maintainers.  Through March of 2019, the unit will receive approximately 350 JLTVs as it becomes the Army's first unit equipped with the new capability.\n\nThe Army will follow that fielding later this year with deliveries to the 173rd Airborne Brigade, Vicenza, Italy, and anticipates achieving initial operating capability in early FY2020.\n \n  \n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nThe Army is intent on modernizing to make Soldiers more lethal.  The JLTV meets the challenges of a 21st century, full-spectrum operating environment with flexible capabilities and connectivity across the services.  It fills a critical gap by rebalancing available payload capacity, mobility performance, and Soldier protection, ultimately giving commanders expanded capability and more options. \n  \n**Resources**:\n\n* [3rd Infantry Division](https://www.stewart.army.mil/units/3ID)\n* [Army G-8](http://www.g8.army.mil/)\n* [Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, Technology]( https://www.army.mil/asaalt)\n* [Army Acquisition Support Center](http://asc.army.mil/web)\n* [U.S. Army PEO Combat Support & Combat Service Support](http://www.peocscss.army.mil/)\n* [U.S. Marine Corps PEO Land Systems](http://www.marcorsyscom.marines.mil/PEOs/PEOLS.aspx)\n\n**Related STAND-TO!**: \n\n* [Army Modernization Strategy](https://www.army.mil/standto/2018-06-06)\n* [Multi-Domain Operations](https://www.army.mil/standto/2018-10-04)\n* [Army Equipment Modernization](https://www.army.mil/standto/2017-03-13)\n\n**Related articles**: \n\n* [1ABCT, 3ID Receive first JLTVs](http://www.army.mil/article/216061)\n* [Raider Brigade fields first JLTV](http://www.army.mil/article/216058)\n* [First Joint Light Tactical Vehicles rolling to the field](https://www.army.mil/article/215402/)\n* [JLTV enters low rate production](https://www.army.mil/article/154425/)\n* [Joint Program Office for JLTV changes leadership](https://www.army.mil/article/151907/)\n\n\n",
