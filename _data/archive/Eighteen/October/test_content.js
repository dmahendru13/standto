In support of the National Defense Strategy, the Army Strategy describes how the Army will build a more lethal force to retain overmatch in order to deter, and defeat if necessary, all potential adversaries.\n\n**What has the Army done\/is doing?**\n\nTo achieve the [Army Vision](https:\/\/www.army.mil\/vision?_st) objectives, the Total Army will: build readiness for high-intensity conflict; modernize doctrine, equipment, and formations; and reform the Army to maximize time, money, and manpower. \n\nThe Army Strategy establishes four lines of effort with specific objectives to chart a path of irreversible momentum towards 2028. These lines of effort are: **Readiness, Modernization, Reform, Alliances and Partnerships**.\n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned?**\n\nThe Army Strategy will unfold over the next decade in a series of phases as priorities shift across these lines of effort. Underpinning this strategic approach is an enduring commitment to take care of people and live the Army Values in everything the Army does.\n\nThe following lines of effort (LOEs), implemented through the Army Campaign Plan, are how the Total Army will achieve the Army Vision.\n\n* LOE 1: **Build Readiness** -- It is the Army's Title 10 responsibility to generate ready forces that are organized, trained, and equipped for prompt and sustained ground combat. The Army's main effort through 2022 is building warfighting readiness and lethality to prioritize preparedness for war and other large-scale contingency operations.\n\n* LOE 2: **Modernization** -- Modernization ensures the Army will continue to have overmatch in a fundamentally different future environment. While the Army focuses on building readiness in the near term, the Army will prioritize research and development on the six modernization priorities defined by the [Army Modernization Strategy](https:\/\/www.army.mil\/standto\/2018-06-06).\n\n* LOE 3: **Reform** -- It is imperative the Army implements aggressive reforms by 2020 to free up time, money, and manpower for its highest priorities and to empower subordinate commanders to make more timely and effective decisions.\n\n* LOE 4: **Strengthen Alliances and Partnerships** -- The Army will continue to train and fight with allies and partners, and therefore, must strive to integrate them further into operations to increase interoperability. \n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nThe Army Strategy describes the strategic environment and the lines of effort the Army will pursue to achieve the Army Vision by 2028. The Total Army will build readiness, modernize concepts and capabilities, reform processes; and strengthen the alliances and partnerships to ensure land power dominance on any battlefield, against any threat, at any time.\n \n**Resources**:\n\n* [Army Strategy](https:\/\/www.army.mil\/e2\/downloads\/rv7\/the_army_strategy_2018.pdf)\n* [Army Vision](https:\/\/www.army.mil\/vision?_st)\n* [National Defense Strategy](https:\/\/dod.defense.gov\/Portals\/1\/Documents\/pubs\/2018-National-Defense-Strategy-Summary.pdf)\n\n**Related STAND-TO!**:\n\n* [Army Vision](https:\/\/www.army.mil\/standto\/2018-06-07)\n* [Army Modernization Strategy](https:\/\/www.army.mil\/standto\/2018-06-06)\n* [Army Modernization](https:\/\/www.army.mil\/standto\/2018-01-16)\n* [Multi Domain Operations](https:\/\/www.army.mil\/standto\/2018-10-04)\n* [Army Talent Management](https:\/\/www.army.mil\/standto\/archive_2018-10-10)\n* [Readiness](https:\/\/www.army.mil\/standto\/2017-10-04)\n\n \n",

        "body": "#######Provided by U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center\n\n**What is it?**\n\nThe Army Readiness Assessment Program is a web-based tool that provides battalion-level commanders with an in-depth look into their formation's readiness posture. This program samples unit safety climate and culture in five key segments:  \n\n* (1) Process auditing, \n* (2) Rewards systems\n* (3) Quality assurance  \n* (4) Risk management \n* (5) Command and control\n\n**What has the Army done\/is doing?**\n\nArmy Readiness Assessment Program compiles Soldier perceptions of their formation's command climate and safety, with an emphasis on safety concerns, through an anonymous online survey. Following the survey, leaders are provided with a candid look at their organization's safety culture and risk management processes. Over the past 12 years, this tool has empowered battalion-level commanders and their staffs with user-friendly capabilities to conduct data and trend analysis effectively. \n \nPer [Army Regulation 385-10](https:\/\/safety.army.mil\/ShrinkLink\/177), commanders or their representatives must ensure all battalion and equivalent organizations enroll in ARAP within 90 days of assuming command.\n\nSince the program's inception in 2006, Soldiers across the Army have completed over 2.6 million surveys. The USACRC Army Readiness Assessment Program team continues to enroll and debrief 20 to 30 organizations weekly. Army Readiness Assessment Program also provide access codes for all brigade and higher level commands to monitor and manage subordinate organizations participation in the program. \n\nBased on a recent directive from the Secretary of the Army and Chief of Staff of the Army, the division and brigade leaders will be privy to the readiness assessment scores obtained by their units. This will facilitate mentoring of the units and allow leaders to shape areas and programs that need assistance.\n \n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned?**\n\nLeaders will continue to integrate Army Readiness Assessment Program as a key component in accomplishing their annual loss prevention objectives. The assessment results will proactively help leaders and supervisors in developing preventive measures to reduce accidental loss. \n\nThe improved technology and suggestions from customers in the field and the USACRC staff has resulted in several program initiatives, which are in development for future implementation. The intent is to tailor assessments for different functional organizations (ground, air and civilian centric). These initiatives facilitate the Army's proven ability to share common data points with other DOD agencies in the future. \n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nLeaders recognize Army Readiness Assessment Program as an indispensable part of the organization's safety plan. Army Readiness Assessment Program provides immediate feedback to assist leadership in preserving resources and saving lives. The Army's first priority is readiness, and this program assists leaders with loss prevention of deployed Soldiers and civilians.\n\n**Resources**:\n\n* [USACRC](https:\/\/safey.army.mil) \n* [ARAP](https:\/\/arap.safety.army.mil)\n\n**Related documents**:\n\n* [Army Regulation 385-10, The Army Safety Program]( https:\/\/safety.army.mil\/ShrinkLink\/177)\n* [ARAP Information Brief - Army Readiness Assessment Program](https:\/\/www.army.mil\/e2\/c\/downloads\/333380.pdf)\n\n**Related STAND-TO!**:\n\n* [The Army Safety Program](https:\/\/www.army.mil\/stando\/2018-01-03)\n\n\n \n",

By including generation assets on or near Army land with associated energy storage and controls, the Army can enable the direct routing of electricity to essential requirements in the event of a grid disruption or other power emergencies.\n\n\n**What has the Army done\/is doing?**\n\nThe [Office of Energy Initiatives](https:\/\/www.asaie.army.mil\/Public\/ES\/oei\/index.html) (OEI) serves as the   Army's central management office for development, implementation and oversight of all privately financed, large-scale energy projects focused on achieving resilience on Army installations.  The OEI project portfolio accounts for approximately 300 megawatts (MW) of energy generation.   \n\nThe Schofield Barracks 50 MW multi-fuel power generation plant was built above the tsunami strike zone, on Army land, at no cost to the Army through third party financing. The multi-fuel project can provide power to three Army installations in the event of a major grid disruption. \n\nThe Redstone Arsenal, Alabama 10 MW solar and battery storage project is the Army's first privately-funded, commercially available, and economically viable battery energy storage system. The energy generated by the project is enough to power about 2,500 homes for one year. \n \n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned?**\n\nThe Army is seeking to achieve energy security and resilience via power generating assets, along with storage and control components. Army investments in these microgrids are in support of the Army's goal for installations to become capable of providing the necessary energy resources to sustain critical missions for a minimum of 14 days in the event of a major disruption in supply.\n\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nEnhancing the Army's energy security and resilience is operationally necessary, financially prudent, and mission critical.  Incorporating energy security, sustainability, and resilience into everyday decision-making processes better positions the Army to successfully deploy and rapidly respond whenever and wherever needed.\n\n\n**Resources**:\n\n* [Assistant Secretary of the Army (Installation, Energy and Environment)](https:\/\/www.army.mil\/ASAIEE)\n* [Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Energy and Sustainability)](http:\/\/www.asaie.army.mil\/Public\/ES\/)\n* [Army Office of Initiatives (OEI)](http:\/\/www.asaie.army.mil\/Public\/ES\/oei\/index.html)\n\n\n**Related documents**:\n\n* [Energy Security and Sustainability Strategy]( https:\/\/www.army.mil\/e2\/c\/downloads\/394128.pdf)\n* [Army Directive 2017-07 (Installation Energy and Water Security Policy)]( http:\/\/www.asaie.army.mil\/Public\/ES\/doc\/Army_Directive_2017-07.pdf) \n* [ASA (IE&E) Strategy 2025](https:\/\/www.army.mil\/e2\/c\/downloads\/472099.pdf)\n\n**Related STAND-TO!**:\n\n* [Army Energy Action Month](https:\/\/www.army.mil\/standto\/2018-10-02)\n* [Army Energy and Water Security](https:\/\/www.army.mil\/standto\/2018-10-16)\n\n**Social media presence**:\n\n* [Army ASA (IE&E) Facebook](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ASAIEE) \n* [Army OEI Facebook](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ArmyOEI)\n* [Twitter: @ArmyOEI](https:\/\/twitter.com\/ArmyOEI)\n\n",

The Army can deliver the vehicle to the field by airdrop or helicopter, increasing the flexibility of Soldiers on the move:\n\n* Nine-man squad carrying capability\n* Payload of 3,200 pounds\n* Internal\/external lift by CH-47, Chinook helicopter\n* Low-Velocity Air Drop by fixed-wing C-130 or C-17 transport aircraft\n* Exceptional mobility over all terrains \n\n**What has the Army done\/is doing?**\n\nTo accelerate delivering an enhanced tactical mobility system to key units, the Army, leveraged the existing, competitively awarded U.S,. Special Operations Command GMV 1.1 contract. The Army awarded its first order in May 2018 and fielded the first Army-GMV (A-GMV) 1.1 system to a company-size element in the 82nd Airborne Division in September 2018.  \n\nThe A-GMV 1.1 is currently in low rate initial production, executing an order for the first 118 vehicles and support. \n \n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned?**\n\nThe Army will order an additional 59 vehicles in fiscal year 2019, ultimately fielding 177 total A-GMV 1.1s to equip three Airborne IBCTs by end of 2019.\n\nAfter meeting the critical, limited fielding need with A-GMV 1.1, the Army will follow with production of the Infantry Squad Vehiclea long-term solution to give the same highly mobile capability to every IBCT.  The Army expects to begin a full and open competition for the Infantry Squad Vehicle in fiscal year 2019, procuring up to 2,065 vehicles that will be fielded to all IBCTs and ultimately serve as a replacement for the A-GMV 1.1.\n\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nThe Army needs flexible, resilient ground formations to project combat power in a multi-domain environment.  \n\nEnhanced mobility platforms will enable early entry forces to envelop, infiltrate, and penetrate in and\/or across multiple domains at select points of entry.   These mobile platforms provide our Forces with enhanced tactical and operational advantage.  \n\n\n**Resources**:\n\n* [Army G-8](http:\/\/www.g8.army.mil\/)\n* [Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, Technology]( https:\/\/www.army.mil\/asaalt) \n* [U.S. Army PEO Combat Support & Combat Service Support]( http:\/\/www.peocscss.army.mil\/) \n* [Maneuver Center of Excellence](http:\/\/www.benning.army.mil\/MCoE\/)\n* [82nd Airborne Division](https:\/\/www.bragg.army.mil\/index.php\/units-tenants\/82nd-airborne-division)\n\n\n**Related STAND-TO!**:\n\n* [82nd Airborne Division](https:\/\/www.army.mil\/standto\/2018-05-16)\n\n**Related article**:\n\n* [Airborne drop tests in progress for potential SOF Ground Mobility Vehicle]( https:\/\/www.army.mil\/article\/203446\/airborne_drop_tests_in_progress_for_potential_sof_ground_mobility_vehicle)",

        "body": "#######Provided by Headquarters, Deputy Chief of Staff, G-1\n\n\n**What is it?**\n\nThe Workplace and Gender Relations Survey of Active Duty Members (WGRA) is a congressionally mandated survey that provides information on sexual assault, sexual harassment and gender discrimination in the military. The WGRA is the DOD's only official tool to measure the prevalence of sexual violence in the military. This survey is voluntary and completely confidential.    \n\n**What has the Army done\/is doing?**\n\nThe Army is committed to combating and preventing sexual violence. Senior leaders are strongly encouraging Soldiers to complete the 2018 WGRA. The WGRA survey is available to a [select group](https:\/\/www.dodsurveys.mil\/) of Soldiers who are part of a scientifically based sample.  This survey, available only until end October, can be completed on a government or personally owned computer.\n\nIn 2016, Soldiers completed more than 44,900 surveys. The Army was the only service to increase its rate of participation as compared to the 2012 WGRA.  \nThe Army has used previous WGRA results to improve policies and services.  Based on the 2012 WGRA result that indicated more service men had been sexually assaulted than service women, the Army took steps to better educate Soldiers about these experiences. The Army developed communication materials focused on male sexual assault and collaborated with the [Department of Veterans Affairs]( https:\/\/www.va.gov\/), [1in6](https:\/\/1in6.org\/), [Male Survivor](https:\/\/www.malesurvivor.org\/index.php), and others to increase overall awareness of sexual awareness through outreach initiatives.\n\n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned?**\n\nThe Army continues to focus on the [Sexual Harassment\/Assault Response and Prevention Program](http:\/\/www.sexualassault.army.mil\/)'s five lines of effort: prevention, advocacy, assessment, investigation, and accountability.  In addition, the Army is increasing its focus on prevention.  The Army aims to stop incidents before they happen by fostering a healthy organizational climate and instilling a strong culture based on the Army Ethic and Values.  The WGRA results will help inform these efforts.\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nThere is no place for sexual assault or harassment in America's Army. Sexual violence has a devastating impact on the Army - it destroys unit cohesion and undermines mission readiness. The WGRA survey is critical to understanding the presence or absence of sexual violence in the ranks.  Results from the survey will help improve policies and services for Soldiers.\n\n \n**Resources**:\n\n* [DOD Office of People Analytics Surveys](http:\/\/www.dodsurveys.mil) \n* [SHARP](http:\/\/www.army.mil\/sharp)\n\n**Related STAND-TO!**:\n\n* [Army Value](https:\/\/www.army.mil\/standto\/2018-06-12)\n* [Army Ethics](https:\/\/www.army.mil\/standto\/2018-07-12)\n* [Army SHARP Learning Strategy](https:\/\/www.army.mil\/standto\/2018-08-20) \n\n\n ",

This is a vital DOD function and directly supports the Army Readiness and the ability to care for the troops.\n\n**What has the Army done\/is doing?**\n\nLessons learned from the Sep. 11,  2001 terrorist attacks led to a [Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative](https:\/\/nsi.ncirc.gov\/)(NSI).  Building from this initiative, the DOD and Army established policies and procedures for threat information sharing and suspicious activity reporting (SAR). In May 2010, the Secretary of Defense designated the eGuardian system the authorized DOD law enforcement SAR system.  Implementation of terrorist threat reporting begins at the local level.\n\nSAR system directly feeds into Federal Bureau of Investigation's eGuardian system, a sensitive but unclassified reporting system, to collect terrorist threat information and suspicious activity and shares the information with other Federal, State, local, and tribal law enforcement.  \n\nThroughout FY18, Army antiterrorism initiatives increased understanding of the evolving terrorist threat and protective measures.  The Army's most recent efforts to counter the threat include changes to antiterrorism training, expanded information sharing, and increased community outreach, with emphasis on the need to protecting \"soft\" targets (such as public events, standalone facilities, and units\/personnel in transit).  \n\nArmy community-wide vigilance and educating the community on the importance of reporting suspicious activities remains a key component to counter this persistent threat.\n\n \n**What continued efforts does the Army have planned?**\n\nThe Army is fielding the Joint Analytic Real-time Virtual Information Sharing System (JARVISS), which fuses and transforms vast amounts of complex, open source and proprietary data into actionable information, providing the Army a smarter way to mitigate risks.  The Army also continues to expand the capabilities and interagency fusion of the Army Threat Integration Center and the Army's use of eGuardian for terrorist threat reporting.  At the local level, a continuous focus is educating community members on the potential threat of terrorist activities. \n\nOther priorities for FY19 include the quarterly focus on the following themes: \n\n* 2Q: Assessing and Understanding the Terrorist Threat\n* 3Q: Individual Antiterrorism Awareness Course\n* 4Q: Planning for Security and Consideration when Attending Special Events\n* February 2019:  Annual Antiterrorism Training Seminar\n\n**Why is this important to the Army?**\n\nPeople are the Army's greatest asset and protecting Army communities is a vital responsibility to preserve readiness.  \n\n**Resources:**\n* [Army Office of the Provost Marshal General](https:\/\/www.army.mil\/opmg)\n* [Army Antiterrorism Enterprise Portal] (https:\/\/army.deps.mil\/army\/sites\/PMG\/prog\/ATEP\/default.aspx) (ATEP) - - On Internet Explorer, select the DOD eMail certificate in order to gain access\n* Army OneSource (under the iWATCH Army logo):  [Antiterrorism Awareness information](https:\/\/www.myarmyonesource.com\/)\n\n**Related STAND-TO!;**\n\n* [iWATCH Army](https:\/\/www.army.mil\/standto\/2018-07-25)\n* [Army Antiterrorism Program](https:\/\/www.army.mil\/standto\/2018-08-01)\n ",
