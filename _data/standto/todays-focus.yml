body:
  - heading: What is it?
  - paragraph: Expeditionary Signal Battalions (ESB) enable the U.S. Army with uninterrupted mission command and the ability to rapidly deploy and maneuver across the battlefield. 
  - paragraph: ESB-Enhanced (ESB-E) is a modular, scalable, more agile version of the ESB, currently being piloted by the Army.  ESB-E provides alternative tactical network equipment that reduces the reliance on legacy Warfighter Information Network Tactical (WIN-T) equipment.
  - heading: What are the current and past efforts of the Army?
  - list:
    - item: In 2018, the 50th ESB, 35th Theater Tactical Signal Brigade, at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, was chosen as the ESB-E pilot unit. 
    - item: The Program Executive Office for Command, Control and Communications-Tactical (PEO C3T) is working closely with the Network-Cross Functional Team to provide the ESB-E with prototype commercial off-the-shelf equipment packages consisting of small satellite terminals, gateways, and an advanced baseband system. 
    - item: ESB-E leveraged existing Army program of record efforts to move from concept approval to fielding the first company and achieving the initial operating capability in early November 2018. 
    - item: Army program offices are currently fielding two additional companies with ESB-E capability. 
    - item: The ESB-E is currently conducting exercises and training events to provide feedback and inform the overall network design for all ESBs across the Army.
  - heading: What continued efforts does the Army have planned?
  - list: 
    - item: In 2019, the 50th ESB-E's three companies will continue to evaluate sets of equipment so the Army can determine the best configuration to meet the needs of future ESBs. 
    - item: The Army will leverage experimentation and Soldier feedback to inform ESB-E network design, equipping, and force-structure recommendations. 
    - item: Soldier feedback from these events will help inform Army decisions for ESB-E capability set fielding by 2021. 
  - heading: Why is this important to the Army?
  - paragraph: ESB-E will inform Army network design decisions and force structure for future ESBs. This effort will help shape future equipment needs and the force structure of the Army's 24 ESBs. 
  - paragraph: The ESB-E effort supports the Army's tactical network modernization line of effort to unify the network by providing assured network transport in congested environments.   The ESB-E's tactical network communications support will enable a more lethal, mobile, and hardened joint and coalition force, helping the Army retain overmatch against increasingly capable adversaries.
